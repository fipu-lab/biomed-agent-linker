      "document": "Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 outbreak detected in inter-seasonal months during the surveillance of influenza-like illness in Pune, India, 2012-2015 An outbreak of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was detected during the ongoing community-based surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI). Among reported 119 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases (59 cases in the year 2012 and 60 cases in 2015) in summer months, common clinical features were fever (100%), cough (90·7%), sore throat (85·7%), nasal discharge (48·7%), headache (55·5%), fatigue (18·5%), breathlessness (3·4%), and ear discharge (1·7%). Rise in ILI cases were negatively correlated with the seasonal factors such as relative humidity (Karl Pearson's correlation coefficient, i.e. r = -0·71 in the year 2012 and r = -0·44 in the year 2015), while rise in ILI cases were positively correlated with the temperature difference (r = 0·44 in the year 2012 and r = 0·77 in the year 2015). The effective reproduction number R, was estimated to be 1·30 in 2012 and 1·64 in 2015. The study highlights the rise in unusual influenza activity in summer month with high attack rate of ILI among children aged ⩽9 years. Children in this age group may need special attention for influenza vaccination. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 outbreak was confirmed in inter-seasonal months during the surveillance of ILI in Pune, India, 2012-2015.",

      "document": "Data -Driven Implementation of Alarm Reduction Interventions in a Cardiovascular Surgical ICU Alarm fatigue in the ICU setting has been well documented in the literature. The ICU's high-intensity environment requires staff's vigilant attention, and distraction from false and non-actionable alarms pulls staff away from important tasks, creates dissatisfaction, and is a potential patient safety risk if alarms are missed or ignored. This project was intended to improve patient safety by optimizing alarm systems in a cardiovascular surgical intensive care unit (CVSICU). Specific aims were to examine nurses ' attitudes toward clinical alarm signals, assess nurses ' ability to discriminate audible alarm signals, and implement a bundled set of best practices for monitor alarm reduction without undermining patient safety. CVSICU nurses completed an alarm perception survey and participated in alarm discriminability testing. Nurse survey data and baseline monitor alarm data were used to select targeted alarm reduction interventions, which were progressively phased in. Monitor alarm data and cardiorespiratory event data were trended over one year. Five of the most frequent CVSICU monitor alarm types- pulse oximetry, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse oximetry sensor, and ventricular tachycardia > 2-were targeted. After implementation, there was a 61% reduction in average alarms per monitored bed and a downward trend in cardiorespiratory events. To reduce alarm fatigue it is important to decrease alarm burden through targeted interventions. Methods to reduce non-actionable alarms include adding short delays to allow alarm self-correction, adjusting default alarm threshold limits, providing alarm notification through a secondary device, and teaching staff to optimize alarm settings for individual patients.",

A major challenge nowadays is to identify novel biomarkers to detect as early as possible metabolic dysfunction and to predict evolution of health status in order to refine nutritional advices to specific population groups. Omics technologies such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics coupled with statistical and bioinformatics tools have already shown great potential in this research field even if so far only few biomarkers have been validated. For the past two decades, important analytical techniques have been developed to detect as many metabolites as possible in human biofluids such as urine, blood, and saliva. In the field of food science and nutrition, many studies have been carried out for food authenticity, quality, and safety, as well as for food processing. Furthermore, metabolomic investigations have been carried out to discover new early biomarkers of metabolic dysfunction and predictive biomarkers of developing pathologies (obesity, metabolic syndrome, type-2 diabetes, etc.). Great emphasis is also placed in the development of methodologies to identify and validate biomarkers of nutrients exposure.",

      "document": "Comparison of Occlusive and Open Application in a Psoriasis Plaque Test Design, Exemplarily Using Investigations of Mapracorat 0.1% Ointment versus Vehicle and Reference Drugs Psoriasis plaque tests (PPTs) are important tools in the early phases of antipsoriatic drug development. Two distinct PPT design variants (open vs. occluded drug application) are commonly used, but no previous work has aimed to directly compare and contrast their performance. We compared the antipsoriatic efficacy of mapracorat 0.1% ointment and reference drugs reported in 2 separate studies, representing open and occluded PPT designs. The drug effect size was measured by sonography (mean change in echo-poor band thickness), chromametry, and standardized clinical assessment. Antipsoriatic effects were detectable for the study drugs in both occluded and open PPTs. Differences between the potency of antipsoriatic drugs and vehicle were observable. The total antipsoriatic effect size appeared to be higher in the occluded PPT than the open PPT, despite the shorter treatment duration (2 vs. 4 weeks). Effect dynamics over time revealed greater differences between some study drugs in the open PPT compared to the occluded PPT. Taking the higher technical challenges for the open PPT into account, we recommend the occluded PPT as a standard screening setting in early drug development. In special cases, considering certain drug aspects or study objectives that would require procedural adaptations, an open PPT could be the better-suited design. Finally, both PPT models show clear advantages: classification as phase I studies, small number of psoriatic subjects, relatively short study duration, excellent discrimination between compounds and concentrations, parallel measurement of treatment response, and go/no go decisions very early in clinical development.",

      "document": "Involvement of intracellular Zn(2+) signaling in LTP at perforant pathway - CA1 pyramidal cell synapse Physiological significance of synaptic Zn(2+) signaling was examined at perforant pathway - CA1 pyramidal cell synapses. In vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) at perforant pathway - CA1 pyramidal cell synapses was induced using a recording electrode attached to a microdialysis probe and the recording region was locally perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) via the microdialysis probe. Perforant pathway LTP was not attenuated under perfusion with CaEDTA (10 mM), an extracellular Zn(2+) chelator, but attenuated under perfusion with ZnAF-2DA (50 μM), an intracellular Zn(2+) chelator, suggesting that intracellular Zn(2+) signaling is required for perforant pathway LTP. Even in rat brain slices bathed in CaEDTA in ACSF, intracellular Zn(2+) level, which was measured with intracellular ZnAF-2, was increased in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare where perforant pathway - CA1 pyramidal cell synapses were contained after tetanic stimulation. These results suggest that intracellular Zn(2+) signaling, which originates in internal stores/ proteins, is involved in LTP at perforant pathway - CA1 pyramidal cell synapses. Because the influx of extracellular Zn(2+), which originates in presynaptic Zn(2+) release, is involved in LTP at Schaffer collateral - CA1 pyramidal cell synapses, synapse -dependent Zn(2+) dynamics may be involved in plasticity of postsynaptic CA1 pyramidal cells.",

The effect of the addition of EPE triblock copolymer on the thermal stability, morphology, and mechanical properties of cellulose triacetate films was investigated. The triblock EPE was chosen since PEO blocks interact favorably with CTA, whereas, PPO blocks remain immiscible which provokes a microphase separation. This allows to obtain EPE / CTA composite films with ordered microphase-separated structures where PPO spherical microdomains are well-dispersed in PEO / CTA matrix by simple solvent - evaporation process. During this process, PEO block chains selectively interact with CTA by strong interpolymer hydrogen-bonding while PPO block microseparated. The addition even 40wt% of EPE leads to nanostructured EPE / CTA composite. The cytotoxicity assay of CTA and EPE / CTA composite films confirm non-toxic character of designed transparent nanostructured composites based on sustainable matrices.",

      "document": "The recurrent domestication of viruses: major evolutionary transitions in parasitic wasps Several lineages of endoparasitoid wasps, which develop inside the body of other insects, have domesticated viruses, used as delivery tools of essential virulence factors for the successful development of their progeny. Virus domestication s are major evolutionary transitions in highly diverse parasitoid wasps. Much progress has recently been made to characterize the nature of these ancestrally captured endogenous viruses that have evolved within the wasp genomes. Virus domestication from different viral families occurred at least three times in parasitoid wasps. This evolutionary convergence led to different strategies. Polydnaviruses (PDVs) are viral gene transfer agents and virus -like particles of the wasp Venturia canescens deliver proteins. Here, we take the standpoint of parasitoid wasps to review current knowledge on virus domestications by different parasitoid lineages. Then, based on genomic data from parasitoid wasps, PDVs and exogenous viruses, we discuss the different evolutionary steps required to transform viruses into vehicles for the delivery of the virulence molecules that we observe today. Finally, we discuss how endoparasitoid wasps manipulate host physiology and ensure parasitism success, to highlight the possible advantages of viral domestication as compared with other virulence strategies.",

After transfer between farms, high mortality was observed in fish, associated with back arching, abnormal swimming, and ulcerative skin lesions. Necropsy of moribund individuals revealed hemorrhagic ascites and petechial hemorrhages in the coelomic peritoneum and serosa of internal organs. Acipenserid herpesvirus 2 (AciHV-2) was isolated from external tissue samples, then identified and genotyped by sequencing of the terminase and polymerase genes. In addition, Streptococcus iniae was recovered from internal organs of affected fish. Histologic changes were limited to interstitial hematopoietic areas of the kidney and consisted of small foci of necrosis accompanied by fibrin deposition, minimal inflammatory response, and small numbers of bacterial cocci compatible with streptococci. Identity was confirmed by partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA, rpoB, and gyrB genes. Genetic fingerprinting demonstrated a genetic profile distinct from S. iniae isolates recovered from previous outbreaks in wild and cultured fish in North America, South America, and the Caribbean. Although the isolates were resistant to white sturgeon complement in serum killing assays, in vivo challenges failed to fulfill Koch's postulates. However, the clinical presentation, coupled with consistent recovery of S. iniae and AciHV-2 from moribund fish, suggests viral and bacterial co-infection were the proximate cause of death. To our knowledge, this represents the first report of AciHV-2 and S. iniae co-infection in cultured white sturgeon.",

The aim of this study was to explore the presence of CSF-1 and IL-34 in whole saliva in relation to periodontal disease. Protocol validation was assessed in saliva of healthy donors (n=21) by ELISA. Salivary CSF-1, IL-34, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8, a biomarker candidate of periodontitis, were determined in 48 patients (29 periodontitis, 12 gingivitis, 7 healthy) and related to the clinical periodontal parameters bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment loss (AL), and plaque index (PI). An additional separate group of gingivitis (n=21) and part of periodontitis patients (n=11) were subjected to non-surgical periodontal treatment whereupon changes in salivary CSF-1, IL-34, and MMP-8 levels were determined and related to periodontal outcome. Periodontitis patients displayed higher CSF-1 and MMP-8 levels in saliva compared to healthy, while IL-34 levels were lower. Higher CSF-1 / IL-34 ratio was observed in periodontitis patients compared to healthy. There was a positive correlation between CSF-1 and MMP-8 which both correlated negatively to IL-34, in gingivitis and periodontitis. Clinical periodontal parameters correlated positively to CSF-1, MMP-8, and to the CSF-1 / IL-34 ratio and negatively to IL-34 in periodontitis patients. Following treatment CSF-1 and MMP-8 levels decreased along with clinical improvement in gingivitis patients. CSF-1 and IL-34 are present in saliva and seem to have complementary roles in periodontal disease, IL-34 in steady-state and CSF-1 in inflammation.",

Retrospective chart review of adult patients with DKA admitted to the MICU. Results of pre-order set (PRE) were compared to those of data post-order set (POST). The primary outcome was a composite administration of intravenous fluid resuscitation in the first 24 h, insulin bolus and initial insulin infusion rate. Twelve of 60 patients (20%) in the PRE group received treatment compliant with the 2006 guidelines versus 14 of 55 patients (25.5%) in the POST group (OR 1.22 95% CI 0.44 to 3.4, P = 0.51).

Drug loaded magnetic nanoparticles by using external magnetic field could selectively accumulate the drug at the target site and thereby reduce the doses required to achieve therapeutic concentration which may otherwise produce serious side effects on healthy cells. In the present study the artemisinin magnetic nanoparticles were successfully formulated using chitosan by ionic-gelation method. The developed magnetic nanoparticles of artemisinin were smooth and spherical in nature and their size was in the range of 349-445nm. The polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential of the formulated nanoparticles were in the range of 0.373-0.908 and -9.34 to -33.3 respectively. They showed 55% to 62.5% of drug encapsulation efficiency and 20% to 25% drug loading capacity. Around 62% to 78% of artemisinin was released from the artemisinin magnetic nanoparticles over the period of 48h.

      "document": "Vaccination of piglets at 2 and 3 weeks of age with Ingelvac PRRSFLEX® EU provides protection against heterologous field challenge in the face of homologous maternally derived antibodies Due to difficulties in eradicating porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) linked to biosecurity challenges, transmission of the virus and the lack of efficient DIVA vaccines, successful control of PRRS requires a combination of strict management measures and vaccination of both sows and piglets. The present study aimed to assess the efficacy of a recently developed MLV vaccine (Ingelvac PRRSFLEX® EU) in piglets at 2 and 3-weeks of age in the presence of homologous maternally derived antibodies as the dams were vaccinated with the same vaccine strain (ReproCyc® PRRS EU). The study was carried out on a Hungarian farrow to finish farm naturally infected with PRRSv. The study was designed as a blind, placebo controlled side by side trial. ORF5 sequence similarity of the vaccine strain and the resident field strain was 87.8 %. PRRS specific real-time quantitative PCR was performed from serum samples to measure both the viral load and the frequency of virus positive animals. At the time of the natural infection observed in the control group at 10-12 weeks of age, the number of viraemic animals did not increase significantly in the vaccinated group. To understand the infection dynamics, positive PCR samples with low Ct values were sequenced (ORF5) and the data analysis indicated the circulation of wild type virus in both groups, however wild type virus was only found in non-vaccinated animals. Our data indicate that piglets vaccinated at as early as 2 weeks of age with Ingelvac PRRSFLEX® EU were protected both in terms of proportion of viraemic animals and viraemia levels. It has to be highlighted that these results were achieved in piglets with high levels of homologous maternally derived antibodies (MDA) at the time of vaccination.",

      "document": "Use of Platelet Function Testing Before Pipeline Embolization Device Placement: A Multicenter Cohort Study Thromboembolic complications constitute a significant source of morbidity after neurointerventional procedures. Flow diversion using the pipeline embolization device for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms necessitates the use of dual antiplatelet therapy to reduce this risk. The use of platelet function testing before pipeline embolization device placement remains controversial. A retrospective review of prospectively maintained databases at 3 academic institutions was performed from the years 2009 to 2016 to identify patients with intracranial aneurysms treated with pipeline embolization device placement. Clinical and radiographic data were analyzed with emphasis on thromboembolic complications and clopidogrel responsiveness. A total of 402 patients underwent 414 pipeline embolization device procedures for the treatment of 465 intracranial aneurysms. Thromboembolic complications were encountered in 9.2% of procedures and were symptomatic in 5.6%. Clopidogrel nonresponders experienced a significantly higher rate of thromboembolic complications compared with clopidogrel responders (17.4% versus 5.6%). This risk was significantly lower in nonresponders who were switched to ticagrelor when compared with patients who remained on clopidogrel (2.7% versus 24.4%). In patients who remained on clopidogrel, the rate of thromboembolic complications was significantly lower in those who received a clopidogrel boost within 24 hours pre-procedure when compared with those who did not (9.8% versus 51.9%). There was no significant difference in the rate of hemorrhagic complications between groups. Clopidogrel nonresponders experienced a significantly higher rate of thromboembolic complications when compared with clopidogrel responders. However, this risk seems to be mitigated in nonresponders who were switched to ticagrelor or received a clopidogrel boost within 24 hours pre-procedure.",

The aim of this study was to compare clinicopathological factors, adverse events, and clinical outcomes between sentinel node mapping (SNM) and SN dissection (SND) groups and assess the clinical utility of SNNS in patients with EGC. The clinical data of 157 patients with EGC, diagnosed as clinical T1N0M0 with tumors ≤ 40 mm, undergoing SNNS between March 2004 and April 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-seven patients were excluded from the analysis. In the remaining 130 patients, 59 and 71 patients underwent standard lymphadenectomy for SNM and SND, respectively. The sentinel node detection rate in the SNM and SND groups was 98.3% (58/59) and 100% (71/71), respectively. Two (3.5%), 15 (25.9%), and 41 (70.7%) patients having sentinel nodes underwent total gastrectomy, proximal gastrectomy (PG), and distal gastrectomy (DG), respectively, in the SNM group.

There was no significant difference in postoperative complications between the SNM and SND groups (P = 0.781). Survival did not differ between the both groups (P = 0.856).

Here, using gene knockouts in mice we evaluated genetic interaction between loss of Ret and loss of Sema3d, two Hirschsprung disease susceptibility genes. We intercrossed Ret and Sema3d double null heterozygotes to generate mice with the nine possible genotypes and assessed survival by counting various genotypes, myenteric plexus presence by acetylcholinesterase staining and embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) intestine transcriptome by RNA-sequencing. Survival rates of Ret wildtype, null heterozygote and null homozygote mice at E12.5, birth and weaning were not influenced by the genotypes at Sema3d locus and vice-versa. Loss of myenteric plexus was observed only in all Ret null homozygotes, irrespective of the genotypes at Sema3d locus, and Sema3d null heterozygote and homozygote mice had normal intestinal innervation. As compared to wildtype mice intestinal gene expression, loss of Ret in null homozygotes led to differential expression of ∼300 genes, whereas loss of Sema3d in null homozygotes had no major consequence and there was no evidence supporting major interaction between the two genes influencing intestine transcriptome. Overall, given the null alleles and phenotypic assays used, we did not find evidence for genetic interaction between Ret and Sema3d affecting survival, presence of myenteric plexus or intestine transcriptome.",

We show that the best performing published algorithms either find large numbers of fusions in negative control data or suffer from low sensitivity detecting known driving fusions in gold standard settings, such as EWSR1-FLI1. As proof of principle that MACHETE discovers novel gene fusions with high accuracy in vivo, we mined public data to discover and subsequently PCR validate novel gene fusions missed by other algorithms in the ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR3.

Oral health is becoming a major public health problem as the prevalence of non-communicable diseases has greatly increased. Periodontal disease (PD) and caries are among the most prevalent oral diseases. PD accounts for the majority of tooth loss and increases with age. China's third national epidemiological investigation on oral diseases (2005) revealed that periodontitis affected >50% of the adult population. The Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013) have been used to estimate DALYs for 301 acute and chronic diseases and injuries in 188 countries for 1990-2013. The estimation of burden of PD between 1990 and 2013 will provide a unique perspective for planning interventions and developing public health policies for PD even chronic diseases in China. We used the GBD 2013 results for Years of Life Lost (YLLs) and Years Lived with Disability (YLDs) to calculate Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) for PD in China. PD standardized DALYs rate (SDR) per 100,000 persons, the percentage of PD standardized DALYs rate (% PD SDR) in all diseases DALYs, and variance ratio of these two indexes between the years of 1990 and 2013 were compared by province, gender and age groups. Nationwide, compared to 1990, the SDR in 2013 increased slightly from 24.7 to 25.7, while the variance ratio of SDR for provinces in the middle, west and south of China showed a greater variation(4.8-6.2%). The % PD SDR in all disease DALYs increased from 0.06 to 0.11% for all groups. The four highest variance ratios % PD SDR in all diseases DALYs between 1990 and 2013 occurred in the west of China (97, 98.6, 108.4 and 112.8%). The PD SDR changed slightly in the women (20.3 to 21.7), meanwhile the variance ratio of PD SDR and % PD SDR in all diseases DALYs for the women (6.7 and 94.5%) was also higher than for men (2.1 and 60.6%). The highest variance ratio % PD SDR in all oral diseases DALYs occurred between 1990 and 2013 in ages 20 to 24 (50.7%) and 25 to 29 years (50.5%). The PD standardized DALYs rate and % PD SDR in all diseases DALYs in China in 2013 has increased from 1990. Especially, the variance ratio of % PD SDR in all disease DALYs among Young population and women, in the west provinces of China have been becoming the highest in all age groups and national wide. Future intervention measurements should include young women of child-bearing age because women's health impacts infant health. Periodontal disease has risk factors in common with a number of other non-communicable diseases (NCD) and conditions, and focusing on the common behavioral and environmental risk factors would be instrumental in the effective prevention of periodontal disease.",

The alERC overlaps with regions that are affected earliest by Alzheimer's disease pathology, yet its cognitive function remains poorly understood. Previous human fMRI studies have focused on its role in object memory, but rodent studies on the putatively homologous lateral entorhinal cortex suggest that it also plays an important role in representing spatial properties of objects. In order to investigate the cognitive effects of human alERC volume differences, we developed an eyetracking-based task to evaluate intra-item configural processing (i.e., processing the arrangement of an object's features), and used manual segmentation based on a recently- developed protocol to delineate the alERC / pmERC as well as other medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions. In a group of older adult men and women at varying stages of brain atrophy and cognitive decline, we found that intra-item configural processing - regardless of an object's novelty - was strongly predicted by alERC volume, but not by the volume of any other MTL subregion. These results provide the first evidence that the human alERC plays a role in supporting a distinct aspect of object processing, namely attending to the arrangement of an object's component features.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Alzheimer's disease pathology appears earliest in brain regions that overlap with the anterolateral entorhinal cortex (alERC). However, the cognitive role of the alERC is poorly understood. Previous human studies treat the alERC as an extension of the neighboring perirhinal cortex, supporting object memory. Animal studies suggest that the alERC may support the spatial properties of objects. In a group of older adult humans at the earliest stages of cognitive decline, we show that alERC volume selectively predicted configural processing (attention to the spatial arrangement of an object's parts). This is the first study to demonstrate a cognitive role related to alERC volume in humans. This task can be adapted to serve as an early detection method for Alzheimer's disease pathology.",

      "document": "Serotonin and Serotonin Transporters in the Adrenal Medulla: A Potential Hub for Modulation of the Sympathetic Stress Response Serotonin (5-HT) is an important neurotransmitter in the central nervous system where it modulates circuits involved in mood, cognition, movement, arousal, and autonomic function. The 5-HT transporter (SERT; SLC6A4) is a key regulator of 5-HT signaling, and genetic variations in SERT are associated with various disorders including depression, anxiety, and autism. This review focuses on the role of SERT in the sympathetic nervous system. Autonomic / sympathetic dysfunction is evident in patients with depression, anxiety, and other diseases linked to serotonergic signaling. Experimentally, loss of SERT function (SERT knockout mice or chronic pharmacological block) has been reported to augment the sympathetic stress response. Alterations to serotonergic signaling in the CNS and thus central drive to the peripheral sympathetic nervous system are presumed to underlie this augmentation. Although less widely recognized, SERT is robustly expressed in chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla, the neuroendocrine arm of the sympathetic nervous system. Adrenal chromaffin cells do not synthesize 5-HT but accumulate small amounts by SERT -mediated uptake. Recent evidence demonstrated that 5-HT1A receptors inhibit catecholamine secretion from adrenal chromaffin cells via an atypical mechanism that does not involve modulation of cellular excitability or voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels. This raises the possibility that the adrenal medulla is a previously unrecognized peripheral hub for serotonergic control of the sympathetic stress response. As a framework for future investigation, a model is proposed in which stress - evoked adrenal catecholamine secretion is fine-tuned by SERT -modulated autocrine 5-HT signaling.",

      "document": "Hemorrhage Risk of Brain Arteriovenous Malformations During Pregnancy and Puerperium in a North American Cohort Conclusions reached in existing literature about risk of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) hemorrhage during pregnancy are controversial. This study compares the risk of hemorrhage in pregnant and nonpregnant female patients with AVM in a North American cohort. We retrospectively reviewed female patients with AVM evaluated from 1990 to 2015. Exposure period for pregnancy and puerperium was calculated as 40 and 6 weeks, respectively, for each full-term pregnancy and 6 weeks for each abortion. Hemorrhage events and patient-years were calculated during an exposure period (pregnancy and puerperium), and a nonexposure period defined as either the interval from birth until AVM obliteration or until last follow-up after subtracting exposure period. Poisson rate ratio test was used to compare rate of hemorrhage between exposure and nonexposure periods. For 270 female patients with AVM, mean age was 35.0±19.6 years, and race distribution was white (n=165, 61.1%), black (n=59, 21.9%), Hispanic (n=9, 3.3%), Asian (n=6, 2.2%), and other (n=31, 11.5%). From 191 total pregnancies occurring before AVM obliteration, there were 175 (91.6%) term deliveries and 16 (8.4%) abortions. Overall annual hemorrhage rate for 149 total hemorrhages during an average of 11 097 patient-years was 1.34%. There were 140 hemorrhages in nonexposed women and 9 hemorrhages in pregnant women, translating to an annual hemorrhage rate of 1.3% in nonpregnant women versus 5.7% in pregnant women (P<0.001). Identical analysis for reproductive age patients (15-50) demonstrated a rate of 1.3% versus 7.0% (P<0.001). Our results conflict with those from a recent study describing no increased rate of rupture during pregnancy. This difference may reflect unique population attributes influencing brain AVM hemorrhage during pregnancy.",

Patients with BNP ≥200 pg/mL (High - BNP, n=170) had more advanced HF characteristics, including lower EF (25.0±8.6% vs. 28.1±8.0%, P=0.0008), than those with BNP <200 pg/mL. In the High - BNP patients, peak oxygen uptake (V̇O2) was significantly increased by 8.3±16.2% during the ET program, and changes in peak V̇O2 inversely correlated with changes in BNP (R=-0.453, P<0.0001) and changes in ventilatory efficiency (V̇E / V̇CO2 slope) (R=-0.439, P<0.0001). During a median follow-up of 46 months, patients in the upper tertile of changes in peak V̇O2 (≥13.0%), compared with those in the lower tertile (<1.0%), had lower rates of the composite of all-cause death or HF hospitalization (37.9% vs. 54.4%, P=0.036) and all-cause death (8.6% vs. 24.6%, P=0.056). In the multivariate analysis, change in peak V̇O2 was a significant independent predictor of the composite outcome and all-cause death. Even among advanced HF p atient s with high BNP level, an ET program significantly improved exercise capacity, and a greater improvement in exercise capacity was associated with greater decreases in BNP level and V̇E / V̇CO2 slope and more favorable long-term clinical outcomes.",

      "document": "Partial tetrasomy 11q resulting from an intrachromosomal triplication of a 22 Mb region of chromosome 11 Intrachromosomal triplications are complex chromosomal rearrangements which arise during meiosis or mitosis and lead to a tetrasomic dose of the affected genomic regions. We describe a female patient harboring an intrachromosomal triplication who presented to the Genetics clinic with dysmorphic features, including telecanthus, flat facial profile, and prognathism, short stature, widely spaced nipples, multiple allergy complaints, loose bowel movements, and mild speech delay. Microarray analysis showed a copy number gain of a 22.37 Mb region of chromosome 11 between bands 11q14.1 and 11q22.1. This region contains 95 genes and seven microRNAs, none of which have been implicated in a disease resulting from increased gene dosage. FISH analysis using a probe targeted to the middle of the segment of the copy number gain yielded a pattern indicative of a tetrasomy via an intrachromosomal triplication, with three signals on the long arm of one homologue of chromosome 11 and the fourth on the other homologue. Subsequent FISH analysis showed that the middle triplicated fragment was positioned in an inverted orientation relative to the outer fragments. To investigate the mechanism by which the intrachromosomal triplication occurred, SNP microarray analysis was performed. These results were consistent with the presence of multiple haplotypes in the tetrasomic region and suggest that the intrachromosomal triplication in our patient arose in one parent during meiosis. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

This paper provides data on droplet spectra produced from 6 nozzles in a high - pressure nozzle spray system and 5 rotary nozzle systems for common mosquito adulticides. Spray plume spectra were measured by laser diffraction. High - pressure nozzles were evaluated at pressure s ranging from 500 psi to 6,000 psi. Rotary nozzles were evaluated at rotational speeds ranging from 500 rpm to 24,000 rpm. Measurements were made at wind speeds of 129 km/h (80 mph) to 225 km/h (140 mph). Adulticides included were Fyfanon (®), Aqua-Reslin (®), Dibrom (®), Duet (®), Permanone (®), and the inert mineral oil, Orchex(®) 796. High- pressure nozzles produced spray plumes within the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) label requirements for all configurations tested except for one at a wind speed of 225 km/h, BETE(®) MW125. Air speed had no significant effect on the spray plume volume median diameter (Dv (0.5)) at the speeds tested with Fyfanon (®). The spray plume 90% drop volume diameter (Dv (0.9)) significantly decreased, 13% at the higher wind speed of 225 km/h. Drop size was inversely related to pressure. Dilution of the product formulations increased the Dv (0.5) of the spray plume but it did not exceed the label requirements. For the PJ15 nozzle, orientation of the nozzle into the wind of up to 135° showed a significant increase in Dv (0.5) at 500 psi, 750 psi, and 1,500 psi. The Dv (0.5) varied <5 μm over the 3 angles examined for any specific pressure. Rotary nozzles produced spray plumes within the EPA label requirements for all test configurations examined. Air speed had no significant effect on Dv (0.5) or Dv (0.9) of the plume at speeds tested with Fyfanon for the ASC A20 nozzle. The rotary AU5000 nozzle using Orchex 796 produced plumes of larger drops in all configurations than any of the rotary nozzles of similar configurations using active ingredient formulations and within EPA label requirements.",

      "document": "Effectiveness of silver diamine fluoride in caries prevention and arrest: a systematic literature review This study aimed to evaluate the scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) in preventing and arresting caries in the primary dentition and permanent first molars. A systematic review (SR) was performed by 2 independent reviewers using 3 electronic databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus). The database search employed the following key words: \" topical fluorides \" AND \" children \" AND \" clinical trials \"; \" topical fluorides \" OR \" silver diamine fluoride \" AND \" randomized controlled trial \"; \" silver diamine fluoride \" AND \" children \" OR \" primary dentition \" AND \" tooth decay \"; \" silver diamine fluoride \" OR \" sodium fluoride varnish \" AND \" early childhood caries \"; and \" silver diamine fluoride \" AND \" children \". Inclusion criteria were articles published in English, from 2005 to January 2016, on clinical studies using SDF as a treatment intervention to evaluate caries arrest in children with primary dentition and/or permanent first molars. Database searches provided 821 eligible publications, of which 33 met the inclusion criteria. After the abstracts were prescreened, 25 articles were dismissed based on exclusion criteria. The remaining 8 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 7 publications were included in the SR. These included 1 study assessing the effectiveness of SDF at different concentrations; 3 studies comparing SDF with other interventions; 2 investigations comparing SDF at different application frequencies and with other interventions; and 1 study comparing semiannual SDF applications versus a control group. The literature indicates that SDF is a preventive treatment for dental caries in community settings. At concentrations of 30% and 38%, SDF shows potential as an alternative treatment for caries arrest in the primary dentition and permanent first molars. To establish guidelines, more studies are needed to fully assess the effectiveness of SDF and to determine the appropriate application frequency.",

In the present study, bone properties of SMP30/GNL knockout (KO) mice with deficiency in vitamin C synthesis were investigated to reveal the effects of SMP30/GNL and exogenous vitamin C supplementation on bone formation. Mineral content (BMC) and mineral density (BMD) of the mandible and femur of SMP30/GNL KO and wild-type mice at 2 and 3 months of age with or without vitamin C supplementation were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Body and bone weight of both age groups decreased and became significantly lower than those of wild-type mice. The bones of SMP30/GNL KO mice were rough and porous, with BMC and BMD significantly below wild-type. Oral supplementation with vitamin C eliminated differences in body weight, bone weight, BMC, and BMD between SMP30/GNL KO and wild-type mice at each age. These results indicate that bone degeneration in SMP30/GNL KO mice was caused by lack of vitamin C, and that this mouse strain is an appropriate model for bone metabolism in humans, which have no ability to synthesize vitamin C.",

A recurrent, mosaic mutation of SMO (c.1234 C>T; p.Leu412Phe) causes CJS. This report describes the gastrointestinal and surgical findings in a baby with CJS who presented with abdominal obstruction and reviews the spectrum of gastrointestinal malformations in this rare disorder. A 41- week, 4,165 g, female presented with craniosynostosis, pre-axial polysyndactyly, and cutaneous findings consistent with a clinical diagnosis of CJS. The infant developed abdominal distension beginning on the second day of life. Surgical exploration revealed an intestinal malrotation for which she underwent a Ladd procedure. Multiple small nodules were found on the surface of the small and large bowel in addition to an apparent intestinal duplication that seemed to originate posterior to the pancreas. Histopathology of serosal nodules revealed bundles of smooth muscle with associated ganglion cells. Molecular analysis demonstrated the SMO c.1234 C>T mutation in varying amounts in affected skin (up to 35%) and intestinal hamartoma (26%). Gastrointestinal features including structural malformations, motility disorders, and upper GI bleeding are major causes of morbidity in CJS. Smooth muscle hamartomas are a recognized feature of children with CJS typically presenting with abdominal obstruction requiring surgical intervention. A somatic mutation in SMO likely accounts for the structural malformations and predisposition to form bowel hamartomas and myofibromas. The mutation burden in the involved tissues likely accounts for the variable manifestations.",

To date, there is no prophylactic vaccine against KSHV. KSHV gpK8.1, gB, and gH / gL glycoproteins, implicated in the virus entry into host cells, are attractive vaccine targets for eliciting potent neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against virus infection. We incorporated gpK8.1, gB, or gH / gL on the surface of virus-like particles (VLPs) and characterized these VLPs for their composition, size, and functionality. To determine which viral glycoprotein(s) elicit the most effective serum - nAbs, we immunized BALB/c mice with gpK8.1, gB, or gH / gL VLPs individually or in combination. Neutralizing antibody assay revealed that sera from mice immunized with the VLPs inhibited KSHV infection of HEK-293 cells in a dose-dependent manner. As a single immunogen, gpK8.1 VLPs stimulated comparable nAb activity to that of UV - inactivated KSHV (UV-KSHV). In contrast, UV-KSHV stimulated higher titers of nAb compared to gB (p = 0.0316) or gH / gL (p = 0.0486). Mice immunized with the combination of gB and gH / gL VLPs had a better nAb response than those immunized with either gB (p = 0.0268), or gH /gL (p = 0.0397) as single VLP immunogens. Immunization with any VLP combination stimulated comparable nAb activity to UV-KSHV serum. Our data provide the first evidence that KSHV gpK8.1, gB, and gH / gL glycoproteins can be incorporated onto the surface of VLPs and used as prophylactic vaccine candidates, with potential to prevent KSHV infection.",

      "document": "High-throughput analysis of sub-visible mAb aggregate particles using automated fluorescence microscopy imaging Aggregation of therapeutic proteins is a major concern as aggregates lower the yield and can impact the efficacy of the drug as well as the patient's safety. It can occur in all production stages; thus, it is essential to perform a detailed analysis for protein aggregates. Several methods such as size exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC), light scattering, turbidity, light obscuration, and microscopy-based approaches are used to analyze aggregates. None of these methods allows determination of all types of higher molecular weight (HMW) species due to a limited size range. Furthermore, quantification and specification of different HMW species are often not possible. Moreover, automation is a perspective challenge coming up with automated robotic laboratory systems. Hence, there is a need for a fast, high-throughput-compatible method, which can detect a broad size range and enable quantification and classification. We describe a novel approach for the detection of aggregates in the size range 1 to 1000 μm combining fluorescent dyes for protein aggregate labelling and automated fluorescence microscope imaging (aFMI). After appropriate selection of the dye and method optimization, our method enabled us to detect various types of HMW species of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Using 10 μmol L(-1) 4,4'-dianilino-1,1'-binaphthyl-5,5'-disulfonate (Bis-ANS) in combination with aFMI allowed the analysis of mAb aggregates induced by different stresses occurring during downstream processing, storage, and administration. Validation of our results was performed by SE-HPLC, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering. With this new approach, we could not only reliably detect different HMW species but also quantify and classify them in an automated approach. Our method achieves high-throughput requirements and the selection of various fluorescent dyes enables a broad range of applications.",

      "document": "Epidemiological study of relapsing fever borreliae detected in Haemaphysalis ticks and wild animals in the western part of Japan The genus Borrelia comprises arthropod-borne bacteria, which are infectious agents in vertebrates. They are mainly transmitted by ixodid or argasid ticks. In Hokkaido, Japan, Borrelia spp. were found in deer and Haemaphysalis ticks between 2011 and 2013; however, the study was limited to a particular area. Therefore, in the present study, we conducted large-scale surveillance of ticks and wild animals in the western part of the main island of Japan. We collected 6,407 host-seeking ticks from two regions and 1,598 larvae obtained from 32 engorged female ticks and examined them to elucidate transovarial transmission. In addition, we examined whole blood samples from 190 wild boars and 276 sika deer, as well as sera from 120 wild raccoons. We detected Borrelia spp. in Haemaphysalis flava, Haemaphysalis megaspinosa, Haemaphysalis kitaokai, Haemaphysalis longicornis, and Haemaphysalis formosensis. In addition, we isolated a strain from H. megaspinosa using Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly medium. The minimum infection rate of ticks was less than 5%. Transovarial transmission was observed in H. kitaokai. Phylogenetic analysis of the isolated strain and DNA fragments amplified from ticks identified at least four bacterial genotypes, which corresponded to the tick species detected. Bacteria were detected in 8.4%, 15%, and 0.8% of wild boars, sika deer, and raccoons, respectively. In this study, we found seasonal differences in the prevalence of bacterial genotypes in sika deer during the winter and summer. The tick activity season corresponds to the season with a high prevalence of animals. The present study suggests that a particular bacterial genotype detected in this study are defined by a particular tick species in which they are present.",

      "document": "Why do Dutch people use dietary supplements? Exploring the role of socio - cognitive and psychosocial determinants In the Netherlands, the prevalence of dietary supplement use has doubled (from 17 to 40 per cent) since the 1980s. Yet, limited data is available on which socio - cognitive factors are associated with dietary supplement use. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to explain dietary supplement use with determinants deriving from the Integrated Change Model (ICM) and from formative research. Socio - cognitive and psychosocial factors were measured among users and non-users of dietary supplements in a longitudinal survey study, with measurements at baseline (N = 1448) and at one-month follow-up (N = 1161). Negative binomial regression analysis was applied to de data. Intention emerged as the main predictor of dietary supplement use (OR = 1.99). Further predictors of dietary supplement use with smaller effect-sizes were: health regulatory focus (promotion, OR = 1.46), social modelling (OR = 1.44), attitude (pros, OR = 1.37), attitude (cons, OR = 0.87), health locus of control (OR = 0.77), and risk perception (chance of getting ill, OR = 1.22). Individuals tend to use dietary supplements if they are promotion oriented, notice dietary supplement users in their social environment, estimate their chances of getting ill higher, and have positive attitude s towards dietary supplements. In contrast, non-users believe that external factors affect their health, and hold negative attitudes towards dietary supplements. Mapping out individuals ' socio - cognitive profile may contribute to the development of online health communication. Based on socio - cognitive and demographical factors, personalised advice can be given about dietary supplement use.",

      "document": "Pancreatic Cystic Lesions: Diagnostic, Management and Indications for Operation. Part I We notice an increasing frequency in the detection and evaluation of pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) over the last three decades. They show awide spectrum of imaging and clinical features. The diagnosis and discrimination of these lesions are very important because of the risk for concurrent or later development of malignancy. The main reason is the increased awareness of these lesions and the extensive use of cross-sectional imaging, an always improving technique (1). Commonly, PCLs are diagnosed incidentally during investigation for often unrelated and nonspecific abdominal complaints using state-of-the art abdominal imaging (CT, MRT). The term PCN denotes a histologically heterogeneous collection of neoplasms showing a wide spectrum of diagnoses, ranging from completely benign to potentially malignant, to carcinoma in situ, to frankly invasive and malignant (2,3). In 1978, Compagno and Oertel were the first to recognize the crucial distinction between the serous and the mucinous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas by explaining the importance of identifying the mucinous neoplasms because of their overt or latent malignant potential (4,5). Since then, the interest in PCLs increased markedly, especially so with the recognition of the importance and prevalence of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). Nowadays, PCLs represent a common and often difficult challenge in clinical practice, because of the increase in their detection in asymptomatic patients and our still immature understanding of some aspects of their biologic behavior. Their important differences regarding their outcome and the fact of being increasingly often identified has put a special focus on these neoplasms by surgeons, pathologists, gastroenterologists, radiologists, and oncologists alike. Management of patients with PCNs can be challenging and varies considerably among the various subtypes of PCNs. Their treatment ranges from resection of malignant lesions, to resection and/or surveillance in the case of premalignant lesions, to simple observation in the case of benign or indolent lesions. Under these circumstances, the accurate classification of PCNs becomes crucial. Therapeutic decision making and classification rely mainly on the presenting symptoms and radiologic findings, often without actual histologic tissue. It is of extreme importance to identify suspicious features indicating potential or certain malignancy in order to select the appropriate treatment. The risk of overtreatment (unnecessary pancreatectomy) should he balanced carefully with the risk of under treatment (missing the opportunity to cure a potentially curable malignant or premalignant disease).",

After we initiated an investigation on the specific role of MagR in cellular response to MS, a subsequent study claimed that MagR expression alone could achieve cellular activation by MS. Here we report that despite systematically testing different ways of measuring intracellular calcium and different MS protocols, it was not possible to detect any cellular or neuronal responses to MS in MagR - expressing HEK cells or primary neurons from the dorsal root ganglion and the hippocampus. By contrast, in neurons co-expressing MagR and channelrhodopin, optical but not MS increased calcium influx in hippocampal neurons.

Early efforts in the field were focused on improving protein identification using sample-specific genomic and transcriptomic sequencing data. More recently, integrative analysis of quantitative measurements from genomic and proteomic studies have identified novel insights into gene expression regulation, cell signaling, and disease. Many methods and tools have been developed or adapted to enable an array of integrative proteogenomic approaches and in this article, we systematically classify published methods and tools into four major categories, (1) Sequence -centric proteogenomics; (2) Analysis of proteogenomic relationships; (3) Integrative modeling of proteogenomic data; and (4) Data sharing and visualization. We provide a comprehensive review of methods and available tools in each category and highlight their typical applications.",

Cardiac genetic disease is a likely etiology. This study investigated the clinical utility and combined yield of post-mortem genetic testing (molecular autopsy) in cases of SADS and comprehensive clinical evaluation of surviving relatives. We evaluated 302 expertly validated SADS cases with suitable DNA (median age: 24 years; 65% males) who underwent next-generation sequencing using an extended panel of 77 primary electrical disorder and cardiomyopathy genes. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were classified using American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) consensus guidelines. The yield of combined molecular autopsy and clinical evaluation in 82 surviving families was evaluated. A gene-level rare variant association analysis was conducted in SADS cases versus controls. A clinically actionable pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was identified in 40 of 302 cases (13%). The main etiologies established were catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and long QT syndrome (17 [6%] and 11 [4%], respectively). Gene-based rare variants association analysis showed enrichment of rare predicted deleterious variants in RYR2 (p = 5 × 10(-5)). Combining molecular autopsy with clinical evaluation in surviving families increased diagnostic yield from 26% to 39%. Molecular autopsy for electrical disorder and cardiomyopathy genes, using ACMG guidelines for variant classification, identified a modest but realistic yield in SADS. Our data highlighted the predominant role of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and long QT syndrome, especially the RYR2 gene, as well as the minimal yield from other genes. Furthermore, we showed the enhanced utility of combined clinical and genetic evaluation.",

      "document": "Young people, mental health practitioners and researchers co-produce a Transition Preparation Programme to improve outcomes and experience for young people leaving Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) In the UK young people attending child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) are required to move on, either through discharge or referral to an adult service, at age 17/18, a period of increased risk for onset of mental health problems and other complex psychosocial and physical changes. CAMHS transitions are often poorly managed with negative outcomes for young people. Better preparation may improve outcomes and experience. This study aimed to co-produce, with young people who had transitioned or were facing transition from CAMHS, a CAMHS Transition Preparation Programme (TPP), deliverable in routine NHS settings. Eighteen young people, aged 17-22, from three UK National Health Service (NHS) mental health foundation trusts participated in creative, participatory research workshops. Seven parents completed short questionnaires. Thirty clinical staff from two trusts took part in workshops to ensure deliverability of young people's ideas. Young people were offered co-research opportunities. Most young people felt anxious, fearful and uncertain on leaving CAMHS and perceived mental health services as uncaring. Participants outlined transition procedures and drafted a range of preparation activities, centred around dedicated Transition Peer Support and a transition booklet, which should be offered to all CAMHS leavers, irrespective of discharge or transfer to an adult service. Preparation should aim to build confidence to help young people take responsibility for themselves and flourish in the adult world: coping or getting through it was not enough. Some clinicians also felt anxious at transition and recognised the potential impact on young people of poor communication and lack of understanding between services. Parents would appreciate help to support their offspring during the transition period. Clinicians cited lack of funding and inflexible NHS procedures and policies as potential barriers to the implementation of young people's ideas. Nine young people took up co-research opportunities. Mental health services underestimate the anxiety of CAMHS leavers. Young people have clear ideas about the preparation they require to leave CAMHS with the confidence to take responsibility for their own health care. Close collaboration of NHS staff and researchers facilitates the implementation of research findings.",

      "document": "Long-range interactions between protein - coated particles and POEGMA brush layers in a serum environment Hydrophilic poly[oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl methacrylate] (POEGMA) brush layers with different thickness and graft densities were prepared by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) to construct a model surface to examine protein - surface interactions in a serum environment. The thickness of the POEGMA brush layers could be well controlled by the polymerization time and density of the immobilized initiators. The interactions between these brush - modified surfaces and the protein - coated polystyrene (PS) particles in newborn calf serum (NBCS) environment were then measured by total internal reflection microscopy (TIRM). In addition, protein adsorption properties onto the polymer brush surface layers were examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Relatively large amounts of protein adsorbed to short (4nm and 9nm-thick) POEGMA - coated surfaces or surfaces grafted with a low density of polymer chains. It was considered that shorter polymer chains or chains with low grafted density cannot fully cover the surfaces, proteins in serum could directly interact with the material surface and then deposited to form an adsorbed layer. The TIRM measurements showed that such adsorbed protein layer could mediate the interactions between the two surfaces by generating steric or bridging forces, resulting in different interaction potentials. Some particles were freely diffusing, some experienced intermittent diffusion and more than 50% of particles were irreversibly deposited to the surfaces covered by short polymer brushes. However, for longer (17 and 30nm-thick) POEGMA brush layer surfaces, material surface would be sufficiently covered by the dense coating and the first step of protein adsorption on surface was avoided. TIRM measurements showed that around 95% of the protein - coated particles could freely move in the serum and no attractive force between two surfaces was detected. The steric repulsion generated from the long POEGMA brush layer in the swollen state was long-range and strong so that the protein adsorption is very unlikely. These results concluded that the adsorbed protein layer on POEGMA surfaces plays an important role in regulating the interaction between protein - coated particles and POEGMA surfaces which are highly repellent toward protein adsorption.",

We discussed the colonial and post - colonial forms, causes and mechanisms of exclusion and their social, economic and ecological outcomes. We examined the range of powers embodied in and exercised through various mechanisms, processes and social relations and their impact on local communities ' access to FPA resources and associated benefits along the historical trajectory of forest governance in Zimbabwe. Results showed that the forms and extent of exclusion changed over time in tandem with the shifting political and economic landscape. During the colonial period, it was total exclusion whereby people were evicted from forest land as well as being denied access to basic resources for their livelihoods. Local communities ' access to low value FPA resources improved during the post-colonial period but access to high value resources like commercial timber as well as sharing income benefits derived from FPA commercial activities remained a pipe dream. Regulation, legitimation, force and markets constituted the mixture of the power elements that FPA governing authorities used to exclude local communities. These powers remained intact despite attempts at collaborative governance in the 1990s. However, from the year 2000, local communities expressed their dissatisfaction with the centralised exclusionary governance system by invading the FPAs rendering them ungovernable.

      "document": "Artificial spatiotemporal touch inputs reveal complementary decoding in neocortical neurons Investigations of the mechanisms of touch perception and decoding has been hampered by difficulties in achieving invariant patterns of skin sensor activation. To obtain reproducible spatiotemporal patterns of activation of sensory afferents, we used an artificial fingertip equipped with an array of neuromorphic sensors. The artificial fingertip was used to transduce real-world haptic stimuli into spatiotemporal patterns of spikes. These spike patterns were delivered to the skin afferents of the second digit of rats via an array of stimulation electrodes. Combined with low - noise intra - and extracellular recordings from neocortical neurons in vivo, this approach provided a previously inaccessible high resolution analysis of the representation of tactile information in the neocortical neuronal circuitry. The results indicate high information content in individual neurons and reveal multiple novel neuronal tactile coding features such as heterogeneous and complementary spatiotemporal input selectivity also between neighboring neurons. Such neuronal heterogeneity and complementariness can potentially support a very high decoding capacity in a limited population of neurons. Our results also indicate a potential neuroprosthetic approach to communicate with the brain at a very high resolution and provide a potential novel solution for evaluating the degree or state of neurological disease in animal models.",

Most are initially reduced using closed reduction. This study introduces a newly developed method, the clip operation via endonasal approach. The operation was performed in these patients by a single surgeon extensively experienced in facial bone fractures. An absorbable mesh plate made into a clip was used for fixation after open reduction via the endonasal approach. No screws were used for fixation. Nasal packing was removed the first day after surgery; aluminum splinting was removed the third week after surgery. Three-dimensional facial computed tomography and cephalolateral radiography were performed preoperatively and postoperatively. Plastic surgeon satisfaction and postoperative complications were assessed. Fracture relapse was not observed. Reduction status was well maintained. Postoperative complications occurred, with a low final incidence of 1.8% in the third postoperative month. Plastic surgeon satisfaction was very high at 4.58. This operation takes 5-10 min, and is simple to perform. It entails a short hospitalization, and the duration during which nasal packing and aluminum splint are maintained is comparable. Undesirable functional, aesthetic complications and secondary surgery resulting from inaccurate relapse were reduced. The clip operation is a useful technique for correcting nasal bone fractures, especially nasomaxillary complex type.",

The use of central venous catheters as dialysis vascular access additionally increases this risk. We describe the first case of Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) secondary to central venous catheter misplacement in a patient with CKD. A 30-year-old female patient with HIV/AIDS and CKD on hemodialysis was admitted to the emergency room for complaints of fever, prostration, and headache in the last six days. She had a tunneled dialysis catheter placed at the left jugular vein. The diagnosis of BCS was established by abdominal computed tomography that showed a partial thrombus within the inferior vena cava which extended from the right atrium to medium hepatic vein, and continuing along the left hepatic vein. Patient was treated with anticoagulants and discharged asymptomatic. Budd-Chiari syndrome is a rare medical condition caused by hepatic veins thrombosis. It can involve one, two, or all three of the major hepatic veins. It is usually related to myeloproliferative disorders, malignancy and hypercoagulable states. This case calls attention for inadvertent catheter tip placement into hepatic vein leading to this rare complication. Assessment of catheter dialysis tip location with radiological image seems to be a prudent measure after each procedure even if the tunneled dialysis catheter has been introduced with fluoroscopy image.",

      "document": "Committee Opinion No. 701 Summary: Choosing The Route Of Hysterectomy For Benign Disease Hysterectomy is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures in the United States. Selection of the route of hysterectomy for benign causes can be influenced by the size and shape of the vagina and uterus; accessibility to the uterus; extent of extrauterine disease; the need for concurrent procedures; surgeon training and experience; average case volume; available hospital technology, devices, and support; whether the case is emergent or scheduled; and preference of the informed patient. Vaginal and laparoscopic procedures are considered \" minimally invasive \" surgical approaches because they do not require a large abdominal incision and, thus, typically are associated with shortened hospitalization and postoperative recovery times compared with open abdominal hysterectomy. Minimally invasive approaches to hysterectomy should be performed, whenever feasible, based on their well-documented advantages over abdominal hysterectomy. The vaginal approach is preferred among the minimally invasive approaches. Laparoscopic hysterectomy is a preferable alternative to open abdominal hysterectomy for those patients in whom a vaginal hysterectomy is not indicated or feasible. Although minimally invasive approaches to hysterectomy are the preferred route, open abdominal hysterectomy remains an important surgical option for some patients. The obstetrician - gynecologist should discuss the options with patients and make clear recommendations on which route of hysterectomy will maximize benefits and minimize risks given the specific clinical situation. The relative advantages and disadvantages of the approaches to hysterectomy should be discussed in the context of the patient 's values and preferences, and the patient and health care provider should together determine the best course of action after this discussion.",

In the search of novel therapeutic strategies for colorectal cancer, in this work we reported the photocytotoxic activity of a lipophilic zinc(II) phthalocyanine on a murine colon adenocarcinoma cell line (CT26 cells). The 2,9(10),16(17),23(24) tetrakis[(2-dimethylamino)ethylsulfanyl]phthalocyaninatozinc(II), named Pc9, was encapsulated into Tetronic® 1107 polymeric poloxamine micelles (T1107) and assayed in 2D and 3D cell cultures. We showed that the formulation Pc9 - T1107 was efficient to reduce cell viability after photodynamic treatment both in 2D cultures (IC50 10±2nM) as well as in CT26 spheroids (IC50 370±11nM). Cellular uptake of Pc9 - T1107 was a time- and concentration-dependent process, being the phthalocyanine formulation mainly incorporated into lysosomal vesicles and endoplasmic reticulum cisterns, but not in mitochondria. Pc9 - T1107 also induced the formation of reactive oxygen species immediately after cell irradiation. We also found that the phototoxic action of Pc9 - T1107 was partially reversed in the presence of antioxidants, such as TROLOX and N-acetyl-cysteine. In addition, we showed that Pc9 - T1107 treatment triggered an apoptotic cell death, as suggested by the detection of pyknotic nuclei, the reduction in the expression levels of procaspase-3 and the increase in caspase-3 enzymatic activity.",

      "document": "Plasma DNA and RNA differentially impact coagulation during abdominal sepsis -an explorative study Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and extracellular RNA (exRNA) are both suspected to activate coagulation cascades in sepsis. Therefore, our study investigated the influence of plasmatic nucleic acids on coagulation in septic patients in comparison to patients after major abdominal surgery. A total of 15 patients with sepsis, 10 postoperative patients, and 10 healthy volunteers were included in this longitudinal study. Blood was collected at sepsis onset and after surgery respectively, as well as after 24, 72 and 168 h. Levels of cfDNA and exRNA were measured by quantitative probe-based polymerase chain reaction. In addition, thromboelastography for coagulation as well as thromboaggregometry for platelet function was conducted. Both cfDNA and exRNA were elevated in patients with sepsis compared with postoperative patients and healthy volunteers. While higher exRNA levels correlated with a faster clotting time and more stable clots, cfDNA correlated with a shorter clotting time but also less fibrinolysis. In addition, higher cfDNA seems to be associated with kidney dysfunction as well as with general markers of cell damage (lactate dehydrogenase and lactate). Both nucleic acid species might be associated with different effects on coagulation during sepsis, with an overall procoagulatory influence. For this reason, individualized therapeutic approaches in patients suffering from coagulation - associated organ dysfunction might be feasible.",

      "document": "A Fluorescent Split Aptamer for Visualizing RNA-RNA Assembly In Vivo RNA-RNA assembly governs key biological processes and is a powerful tool for engineering synthetic genetic circuits. Characterizing RNA assembly in living cells often involves monitoring fluorescent reporter proteins, which are at best indirect measures of underlying RNA-RNA hybridization events and are subject to additional temporal and load constraints associated with translation and activation of reporter proteins. In contrast, RNA aptamers that sequester small molecule dyes and activate their fluorescence are increasingly utilized in genetically encoded strategies to report on RNA - level events. Split-aptamer systems have been rationally designed to generate signal upon hybridization of two or more discrete RNA transcripts, but none directly function when expressed in vivo. We reasoned that the improved physiological properties of the Broccoli aptamer enable construction of a split-aptamer system that could function in living cells. Here we present the Split-Broccoli system, in which self-assembly is nucleated by a thermostable, three-way junction RNA architecture and fluorescence activation requires both strands. Functional assembly of the system approximately follows second-order kinetics in vitro and improves when cotranscribed, rather than when assembled from purified components. Split-Broccoli fluorescence is digital in vivo and retains functional modularity when fused to RNAs that regulate circuit function through RNA-RNA hybridization, as demonstrated with an RNA Toehold switch. Split-Broccoli represents the first functional split-aptamer system to operate in vivo. It offers a genetically encoded and nondestructive platform to monitor and exploit RNA-RNA hybridization, whether as an all- RNA, stand-alone AND gate or as a tool for monitoring assembly of RNA-RNA hybrids.",

We report a sub-group analysis of fetuses with abnormalities of the posterior fossa diagnosed on antenatal USS (with or without ventriculomegaly) from the MERIDIAN cohort who had iuMR imaging within 2 weeks of USS and outcome reference data were available. The diagnostic accuracy of USS and iuMR are reported as well as indicators of diagnostic confidence and effects on prognosis and clinical management. Abnormalities confined to the posterior fossa according to USS were found in 81 fetuses (67 with parenchymal and 14 with CSF -containing lesions). The overall diagnostic accuracy for detecting an isolated posterior fossa abnormality was 65% for USS and 88% for iuMR (difference = 22%, 95% CI: 14.0 to 30.5%, p < 0.0001). There was an improvement in ' appropriate ' diagnostic confidence as assessed by a score - based weighted average ' method (p < 0.0001) and a three-fold reduction in 'high confidence but incorrect diagnoses ' was achieved by using iuMR imaging. The prognostic information given to the women after iuMR imaging changed in 44% of cases and the overall effect of iuMR on clinical management was considered to be ' significant ', ' major ' or ' decisive ' in 35% of cases. Our data suggests that any woman whose fetus has a posterior fossa abnormality as the only intracranial finding on USS should have iuMR imaging for further evaluation. This is on the basis of improved diagnostic accuracy and confidence which has substantial effects on the prognostic information given to women and changes in clinical management.",

      "document": "3D printing scaffold coupled with low level light therapy for neural tissue regeneration 3D printing has shown promise for neural regeneration by providing customized nerve scaffolds to structurally support and bridge the defect gap as well as deliver cells or various bioactive substances. Low-level light therapy (LLLT) exhibits positive effects on rehabiliation of degenerative nerves and neural disorders. With this in mind, we postulate that 3D printed neural scaffold coupling with LLLT will generate a new strategy to repair neural degeneration. To achieve this goal, we applied red laser light to stimualte neural stem cells on 3D printed scaffolds and investigated the subsequent cell response with respect to cell proliferation and differentiation. Here we show that cell prolifeartion rate and intracellular reactive oxgen species synthesis were significantly increased after 15 s laser stimulation follwed by 1 d culture. Over culturing time of 14 d in vitro, the laser stimulation promoted neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells, while the glial differentiation was suppressed based on results of both immunocytochemistry studies and real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. These findings suggest that integration of 3D printing and LLLT might provide a powerful methodology for neural tissue engineering.",

      "document": "The role of cPLA2 in Methylglyoxal - induced cell apoptosis of HUVECs Methylglyoxal (MGO), a highly reactive dicarbonyl compound, is mainly formed as a byproduct of glycolysis. Elevated MGO level is known to induce apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells, which is implicated with progression of atherosclerosis and diabetic complications. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been exhaustively investigated yet. Here, we further characterized the mechanisms how MGO induced apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Our data revealed that cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) played an important role in MGO - induced cell apoptosis. It was found that MGO could increase both the activity and expression of cPLA2. Inhibition of cPLA2 by Pyrrophenone (PYR) or siRNA significantly attenuated the MGO - induced apoptosis. Additionally, MGO time - dependently decreased the phosphorylation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). Pretreatment of the cells with NF-κB inhibitor, BAY11-7082, further increased MGO - induced apoptosis of HUVECs, indicating that NF-κB played a survival role in this MGO - induced apoptosis. Furthermore, in the presence of si-cPLA2 or PYR, MGO no longer decreased NF-κB phosphorylation. Beyond that, the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) could reverse the changes of both cPLA2 and NF-κB caused by MGO. p38, the upstream of cPLA2, was also significantly phosphorylated by MGO. However, p38 inhibitor failed to reverse the apoptosis induced by MGO. This study gives an important insight into the downstream signaling mechanisms of MGO, cPLA2 - NF-κB, in endothelial apoptosis.",

      "document": "Variant 2 of KIAA0101, antagonizing its oncogenic variant 1, might be a potential therapeutic strategy in hepatocellular carcinoma Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal malignant tumors worldwide and effective therapies, including molecular therapy, remain elusive. Our previous work demonstrates that oncogenic KIAA0101 transcript variant (tv) 1 promotes HCC development and might be a HCC therapeutic target. However, the function of another KIAA0101 variant, KIAA0101 tv2, remains unknown. In this study, we reported that KIAA0101 tv2 was highly expressed in adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues (NTs) compared to HCC tissues. In vivo and in vitro results showed that KIAA0101 tv2 decreased cell survival, colony formation, tumor xenografts, migration, and invasion, as well as induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Interestingly, it could inhibit the function of KIAA0101 tv1 by partially down-regulating KIAA0101 tv1, acting similar to KIAA0101 tv1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Further studies illustrated that KIAA0101 tv2 could increase the activity of p53 by competing with KIAA0101 tv1 for P53 binding. In conclusion, KIAA0101 tv2 exerts anti-tumor activity in HCC and acts as an endogenous competitor of tumor-associated KIAA0101 tv1. KIAA0101 tv2 has a potential to work as a therapeutic drug targeting the KIAA0101 tv1 in HCC.",

Oats might increase the nutritional value of a GFD, but their including is controversial. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the safety of oats as part of a GFD in patients with celiac disease. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases for clinical trials and observational studies of the effects of including oats in GFD of patients with celiac disease. The studies reported patients ' symptoms, results from serology tests, and findings from histologic analyses. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence. We identified 433 studies; 28 were eligible for analysis. Of these, 6 were randomized and 2 were not-randomized controlled trials comprising a total of 661 patients -the remaining studies were observational. All randomized controlled trials used pure/uncontaminated oats. Oat consumption for 12 months did not affect symptoms (standardized mean difference: reduction in symptom scores in patients who did and did not consumed oats, -0.22; 95% CI: -0.56 to 0.13; P=.22), histologic scores (relative risk for histologic findings in patients who consumed oats, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.01 to 4.8; P=.35), intraepithelial lymphocyte counts (standardized mean difference: 0.21; 95% CI, reduction of 1.44 to increase in 1.86), or results from serologic tests. Subgroup analyses of adults vs children did not reveal differences. The overall quality of evidence was low. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, we found no evidence that addition of oats to a GFD affects symptoms, histology, immunity, or serologic features of patients with celiac disease. However, there were few studies for many endpoints, as well as limited geographic distribution and low quality of evidence. Rigorous double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trials, using commonly available oats sourced from different regions, are needed.",

Flow diversion using the pipeline embolization device for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms necessitates the use of dual antiplatelet therapy to reduce this risk. The use of platelet function testing before pipeline embolization device placement remains controversial. A retrospective review of prospectively maintained databases at 3 academic institutions was performed from the years 2009 to 2016 to identify patients with intracranial aneurysms treated with pipeline embolization device placement. Clinical and radiographic data were analyzed with emphasis on thromboembolic complications and clopidogrel responsiveness. A total of 402 patients underwent 414 pipeline embolization device procedures for the treatment of 465 intracranial aneurysms. Thromboembolic complications were encountered in 9.2% of procedures and were symptomatic in 5.6%. Clopidogrel nonresponders experienced a significantly higher rate of thromboembolic complications compared with clopidogrel responders (17.4% versus 5.6%). This risk was significantly lower in nonresponders who were switched to ticagrelor when compared with patients who remained on clopidogrel (2.7% versus 24.4%). In patients who remained on clopidogrel, the rate of thromboembolic complications was significantly lower in those who received a clopidogrel boost within 24 hours pre-procedure when compared with those who did not (9.8% versus 51.9%). There was no significant difference in the rate of hemorrhagic complications between groups. Clopidogrel nonresponders experienced a significantly higher rate of thromboembolic complications when compared with clopidogrel responders. However, this risk seems to be mitigated in nonresponders who were switched to ticagrelor or received a clopidogrel boost within 24 hours pre-procedure.",

Here, we describe an evaluation protocol for drug sorption to tubes of administration sets. Tubes made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC)- and non-PVC -based polymeric materials were cut to 1 m in length. Diazepam and tacrolimus were used as model drugs. In the kinetic sorption study, we selected the drug concentration and flow rate based on the clinical usage of these drugs. After the dilution of each drug in a glass bottle, the diluted drug solution was delivered through tubes of administration sets using a pump. Samples were collected in amber vials at appropriate time points and the drugs were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography.

      "document": "Pancreatic Cystic Lesions: Diagnostic, Management and Indications for Operation. Part I We notice an increasing frequency in the detection and evaluation of pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) over the last three decades. They show awide spectrum of imaging and clinical features. The diagnosis and discrimination of these lesions are very important because of the risk for concurrent or later development of malignancy. The main reason is the increased awareness of these lesions and the extensive use of cross-sectional imaging, an always improving technique (1). Commonly, PCLs are diagnosed incidentally during investigation for often unrelated and nonspecific abdominal complaints using state-of-the art abdominal imaging (CT, MRT). The term PCN denotes a histologically heterogeneous collection of neoplasms showing a wide spectrum of diagnoses, ranging from completely benign to potentially malignant, to carcinoma in situ, to frankly invasive and malignant (2,3). In 1978, Compagno and Oertel were the first to recognize the crucial distinction between the serous and the mucinous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas by explaining the importance of identifying the mucinous neoplasms because of their overt or latent malignant potential (4,5). Since then, the interest in PCLs increased markedly, especially so with the recognition of the importance and prevalence of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). Nowadays, PCLs represent a common and often difficult challenge in clinical practice, because of the increase in their detection in asymptomatic patients and our still immature understanding of some aspects of their biologic behavior. Their important differences regarding their outcome and the fact of being increasingly often identified has put a special focus on these neoplasms by surgeons, pathologists, gastroenterologists, radiologists, and oncologists alike. Management of patients with PCNs can be challenging and varies considerably among the various subtypes of PCNs. Their treatment ranges from resection of malignant lesions, to resection and/or surveillance in the case of premalignant lesions, to simple observation in the case of benign or indolent lesions. Under these circumstances, the accurate classification of PCNs becomes crucial. Therapeutic decision making and classification rely mainly on the presenting symptoms and radiologic findings, often without actual histologic tissue. It is of extreme importance to identify suspicious features indicating potential or certain malignancy in order to select the appropriate treatment. The risk of overtreatment (unnecessary pancreatectomy) should he balanced carefully with the risk of under treatment (missing the opportunity to cure a potentially curable malignant or premalignant disease).",

      "document": "The effects of clinical supervision on supervisees and patients in cognitive-behavioral therapy: a study protocol for a systematic review Clinical supervision by a senior therapist is a very common practice in psychotherapist training and psychiatric care settings. Though clinical supervision is advocated by most educational and governing institutions, the effects of clinical supervision on the supervisees ' competence, e.g., attitudes, behaviors, and skills, as well as on treatment outcomes and other patient variables are debated and largely unknown. Evidence-based practice is advocated in clinical settings but has not yet been fully implemented in educational or clinical training settings. The aim of this systematic review is to synthesize and present the empirical literature regarding effects of clinical supervision in cognitive-behavioral therapy. This study will include a systematic review of the literature to identify studies that have empirically investigated the effects of supervision on supervised psychotherapists and/or the supervisees' patients. A comprehensive search strategy will be conducted to identify published controlled studies indexed in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library databases. Data on supervision outcomes in both psychotherapists and their patients will be extracted, synthesized, and reported. Risk of bias and quality of the included studies will be assessed systematically. This systematic review will rigorously follow established guidelines for systematic reviews in order to summarize and present the evidence base for clinical supervision in cognitive-behavioral therapy and may aid further research and discussion in this area.

A high concentration of each fermentation inhibitor represses translation and increases non-translated mRNAs. We previously reported that the mRNAs of ADH7 and BDH2, which encode putative NADPH- and NADH-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases, respectively, were efficiently translated even with translation repression in response to severe vanillin stress. However, the combined effects of these fermentation inhibitors on the expression of ADH7 and BDH2 remain unclear. We herein demonstrated that exposure to a combined stress of vanillin, furfural, and HMF repressed translation. The protein synthesis of Adh7, but not Bdh2 was significantly induced under combined stress conditions, even though the mRNA levels of ADH7 and BDH2 were up-regulated. Additionally, adh7Δ cells were more sensitive to the combined stress than wild-type and bdh2Δ cells. These results suggest that induction of the ADH7 expression plays a role in the tolerance to the combined stress of vanillin, furfural, and HMF. Furthermore, we succeeded in improving yeast tolerance to the combined stress by controlling the expression of ALD6 with the ADH7 promoter. Our results demonstrate that the ADH7 promoter can overcome the pronounced translation repression caused by the combined stress of vanillin, furfural, and HMF, and also suggest a new gene engineering strategy to breed robust and optimized yeasts for bioethanol production from a lignocellulosic biomass.",

      "document": "Silk I and Silk II studied by fast scanning calorimetry Using fast scanning calorimetry (FSC), we investigated the glass transition and crystal melting of samples of B. mori silk fibroin containing Silk I and/or Silk II crystal s. Due to the very short residence times at high temperatures during such measurements, thermal decomposition of silk protein can be significantly suppressed. FSC was performed at 2000K/s using the Mettler Flash DSC1 on fibroin films with masses around 130-270ng. Films were prepared with different crystalline fractions (ranging from 0.26 to 0.50) and with different crystal structures (Silk I, Silk II, or mixed) by varying the processing conditions. These included water annealing at different temperatures, exposure to 50% MeOH in water, or autoclaving. The resulting crystal structure was examined using wide angle X-ray scattering. Degree of crystallinity was evaluated from Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and from analysis of the heat capacity increment at the glass transition temperature. Silk fibroin films prepared by water annealing at 25°C were the least crystalline and had Silk I structure. FTIR and FSC studies showed that films prepared by autoclaving or 50% MeOH exposure were the most crystalline and had Silk II structure. Intermediate crystalline fraction and mixed Silk I / Silk II structure s were found in films prepared by water annealing at 37°C. FSC results indicate that Silk I I crystals exhibit endotherms of narrower width and have higher mean melting temperature Tm(II)=351±2.6°C, compared to Silk I crystals which melt at Tm(I)=292±3.8°C. Films containing mixed Silk I / Silk II structure showed two clearly separated endothermic peaks. Evidence suggests that the two types of crystal s melt separately and do not thermal ly interconvert on the extremely short time scale (0.065s between onset and end of melting) of the FSC experiment. Silkworm silk is a naturally occurring biomaterial. The fibroin component of silk forms two types of crystals. Silk properties depend upon the amount and type of crystals, and their stability. One measure of stability is crystal melting temperature. Crystal s which are more stable have a higher melting temperature. Until now, it has been challenging to study thermal behavior of silk crystal s because they degrade at high temperature. To avoid degradation, and study the melting properties of silk biomaterial, we heated silk at a very fast rate of 2000K/s using a special calorimeter. We have shown that the two crystal types have very different melting temperature s, indicating that one crystal type is much more stable than the other.",

      "document": "Distracting behaviors among teenagers and young, middle-aged, and older adult drivers when driving without and with warnings from an integrated vehicle safety system Negative reinforcement from crash warnings may reduce the likelihood that drivers engage in distracted driving. Alternatively, drivers may compensate for the perceived safety benefit of crash warnings by engaging in distractions more frequently, especially at higher speeds. The purpose of this study was to examine whether warning feedback from an integrated vehicle - based safety system affected the likelihood that various secondary behaviors were present among drivers ages 16-17, 20-30, 40-50, and 60-70. Participants drove an instrumented sedan with various collision warning systems for an extended period. Ten 5-second video clips were randomly sampled from driving periods at speeds above 25 mph and below 5 mph each week for each driver and coded for the presence of 11 secondary behaviors. At least one secondary behavior was present in 46% of video clips; conversing with a passenger (17%), personal grooming (9%), and cellphone conversation (6%) were the most common. The likelihood that at least one secondary behavior was present was not significantly different during period s when drivers received warnings relative to period s without warnings. At least one secondary behavior was 21% more likely to be present at speeds below 5 mph relative to speeds above 25 mph; however, the effect of vehicle speed was not significantly affected by warning presence. Separate models for each of the five most common secondary behaviors also indicated that warnings had no significant effect on the likelihood that each behavior was present. Collision warnings were not associated with significant increases or decreases in the overall likelihood that teen and adult drivers engaged in secondary behaviors or the likelihood of the behaviors at speeds above 25 mph or below 5 mph. There was no evidence that forward collision warning and other technologies like those in this study will increase or decrease distracted driving.",

      "document": "Simulated blast overpressure induces specific astrocyte injury in an ex vivo brain slice model Exposure to explosive blasts can produce functional debilitation in the absence of brain pathology detectable at the scale of current diagnostic imaging. Transient (ms) overpressure components of the primary blast wave are considered to be potentially damaging to the brain. Astrocytes participate in neuronal metabolic maintenance, blood-brain barrier, regulation of homeostatic environment, and tissue remodeling. Damage to astrocytes via direct physical forces has the potential to disrupt local and global functioning of neuronal tissue. Using an ex vivo brain slice model, we tested the hypothesis that viable astrocytes within the slice could be injured simply by transit of a single blast wave consisting of overpressure alone. A polymer split Hopkinson pressure bar (PSHPB) system was adapted to impart a single positive pressure transient with a comparable magnitude to those that might be present inside the head. A custom built test chamber housing the brain tissue slice incorporated revised design elements to reduce fluid space and promote transit of a uniform planar waveform. Confocal microscopy, stereology, and morphometry of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity revealed that two distinct astrocyte injury profiles were identified across a 4 hr post - test survival interval: (a) presumed conventional astrogliosis characterized by enhanced GFAP immunofluorescence intensity without significant change in tissue area fraction and (b) a process comparable to clasmatodendrosis, an autophagic degradation of distal processes that has not been previously associated with blast induced neurotrauma. Analysis of astrocyte branching revealed early, sustained, and progressive differences distinct from the effects of slice incubation absent overpressure testing. Astrocyte vulnerability to overpressure transients indicates a potential for significant involvement in brain blast pathology and emergent dysfunction. The testing platform can isolate overpressure injury phenomena to provide novel insight on physical and biological mechanisms.",

Use of antiarrhythmic drugs in cases of maternal tachyarrhythmia must give due consideration of potential teratogenic side effects. Utilization of antiarrhythmic drugs during pregnancy has been well studied; some result in minimal fetal harm or none at all. New techniques, such as cardiac ablation, have also been implemented with minimal or no radiation exposure to the fetus or mother. Pregnant women with tachyarrhythmia have been successfully treated with little to no impact on the developing fetus as result of increasing experience with antiarrhythmic drugs and progress of new procedural techniques.",

      "document": "Pharmacogenomic identification of small molecules for lineage specific manipulation of subventricular zone germinal activity Strategies for promoting neural regeneration are hindered by the difficulty of manipulating desired neural fates in the brain without complex genetic methods. The subventricular zone (SVZ) is the largest germinal zone of the forebrain and is responsible for the lifelong generation of interneuron subtypes and oligodendrocytes. Here, we have performed a bioinformatics analysis of the transcriptome of dorsal and lateral SVZ in early postnatal mice, including neural stem cells (NSCs) and their immediate progenies, which generate distinct neural lineages. We identified multiple signaling pathways that trigger distinct downstream transcriptional networks to regulate the diversity of neural cells originating from the SVZ. Next, we used a novel in silico genomic analysis, searchable platform-independent expression database / connectivity map (SPIED / CMAP), to generate a catalogue of small molecules that can be used to manipulate SVZ microdomain-specific lineages. Finally, we demonstrate that compounds identified in this analysis promote the generation of specific cell lineages from NSCs in vivo, during postnatal life and adulthood, as well as in regenerative contexts. This study unravels new strategies for using small bioactive molecules to direct germinal activity in the SVZ, which has therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative diseases.",

The aim of this study was to analyse the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidity in a Canary Islands population diagnosed with COPD, and compared it with data from the general population. A cross-sectional study was carried out in 300 patients with COPD and 524 subjects without respiratory disease (control group). The two groups were compared using standard bivariate methods. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the cardiovascular risks in COPD patients compared to control group. Patients with COPD showed a high prevalence of hypertension (72%), dyslipidaemia (73%), obesity (41%), diabetes type 2 (39%), and sleep apnoea syndrome (30%) from mild stages of the disease (GOLD 2009). There was a 22% prevalence of cardiac arrhythmia, 16% of ischaemic heart disease, 16% heart failure, 12% peripheral vascular disease, and 8% cerebrovascular disease. Compared to the control group, patients with COPD had a higher risk of dyslipidaemia (OR 3.24, 95% CI; 2.21-4.75), diabetes type 2 (OR 1.52, 95% CI; 1.01-2,28), and ischaemic heart disease (OR 2.34, 95% CI; 1.22-4.49). In the case of dyslipidaemia, an increased risk was obtained when adjusted for age, gender, and consumption of tobacco (OR 5.04, 95% CI; 2.36-10.74). Patients with COPD resident in the Canary Islands have a high prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidaemia, ischaemic heart disease, and cardiac arrhythmia. Compared to general population, patients with COPD have a significant increase in the risk of dyslipidaemia.",

      "document": "Disease management programs for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Germany: a longitudinal population-based descriptive study The primary aim of the disease management program (DMP) for patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 is to improve the quality of health care and the treatment process. 12 years after its introduction in Germany, there is still no consensus as to whether DMP has been effective in reaching these goals. A retrospective longitudinal population-based study between 2004 and 2015 were conducted to evaluate the DMP for type 2 diabetes in Bavaria using routinely collected patient medical records hold from the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians of Bavaria. During the first 12 years of DMP, the number of participants increased continually to reach 580,222 in 2015. The proportion of participants older than 70 years increased during the observation from 41.6 to 51.1%. The percentage of smokers increased slightly from 9 to 11%. Similarly, the distribution of body mass index remained with approximately 50% of patients having a body mass index >30 kg/m(2). Control of HbA1c was without an appreciable change over the course, with between 8.3 and 9.4% of all patients with uncontrolled values higher than 8.5%. Prescription of metformin increased from 40.5% in 2004 to 54.1% in 2015. Among patients receiving insulin, the proportion receiving a combined therapy with metformin increased from 28.4% in 2004 to 50.8% in 2015. In contrast, the percentage with insulin monotherapy decreased from 55.4 to 33.7%. The proportion of patients with a diabetic education increased within the course from 12.8 to 29.3%. Data from the German DMP for type 2 diabetes demonstrates an improvement in the quality of care with respect to pharmacotherapy and patient education and therefore to an improved adherence to guidelines. However, no appreciable improvement was observed with regard to smoking status, obesity or HbA1c control.",

      "document": "Silk I and Silk II studied by fast scanning calorimetry Using fast scanning calorimetry (FSC), we investigated the glass transition and crystal melting of samples of B. mori silk fibroin containing Silk I and/or Silk II crystal s. Due to the very short residence times at high temperatures during such measurements, thermal decomposition of silk protein can be significantly suppressed. FSC was performed at 2000K/s using the Mettler Flash DSC1 on fibroin films with masses around 130-270ng. Films were prepared with different crystalline fractions (ranging from 0.26 to 0.50) and with different crystal structures (Silk I, Silk II, or mixed) by varying the processing conditions. These included water annealing at different temperatures, exposure to 50% MeOH in water, or autoclaving. The resulting crystal structure was examined using wide angle X-ray scattering. Degree of crystallinity was evaluated from Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and from analysis of the heat capacity increment at the glass transition temperature. Silk fibroin films prepared by water annealing at 25°C were the least crystalline and had Silk I structure. FTIR and FSC studies showed that films prepared by autoclaving or 50% MeOH exposure were the most crystalline and had Silk II structure. Intermediate crystalline fraction and mixed Silk I / Silk II structure s were found in films prepared by water annealing at 37°C. FSC results indicate that Silk I I crystals exhibit endotherms of narrower width and have higher mean melting temperature Tm(II)=351±2.6°C, compared to Silk I crystals which melt at Tm(I)=292±3.8°C. Films containing mixed Silk I / Silk II structure showed two clearly separated endothermic peaks. Evidence suggests that the two types of crystal s melt separately and do not thermal ly interconvert on the extremely short time scale (0.065s between onset and end of melting) of the FSC experiment. Silkworm silk is a naturally occurring biomaterial. The fibroin component of silk forms two types of crystals. Silk properties depend upon the amount and type of crystals, and their stability. One measure of stability is crystal melting temperature. Crystal s which are more stable have a higher melting temperature. Until now, it has been challenging to study thermal behavior of silk crystal s because they degrade at high temperature. To avoid degradation, and study the melting properties of silk biomaterial, we heated silk at a very fast rate of 2000K/s using a special calorimeter. We have shown that the two crystal types have very different melting temperature s, indicating that one crystal type is much more stable than the other.",

To assess clinical outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft in women and men with multivessel coronary disease and unprotected left main disease, a pooled analysis (n=3280) was performed using the patient - level data from 3 large randomized trials: SYNTAX (Synergy between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery), PRECOMBAT (Bypass Surgery Versus Angioplasty Using Sirolimus-Eluting Stent in Patients With Left Main Coronary Artery Disease), and BEST (Bypass Surgery and Everolimus-Eluting Stent Implantation in the Treatment of Patients with Multivessel Coronary Artery Disease) trials. The primary end point was all-cause death. Of 3280 patients, 794 patients (24.2%) were women. The median follow-up period was 1806 days (1611-1837 days). In women, a high heterogeneity of the treatment effect among the 3 trials was found for all-cause death (I(2)>50%), whereas in men, it was consistent across the 3 trials. In the Western trial (SYNTAX), female sex favored coronary artery bypass graft compared with percutaneous coronary intervention (hazard ratio (percutaneous coronary intervention) 2.213; 95% confidence interval, 1.242-3.943; P=0.007), whereas in the Asian women (PRECOMBAT and BEST), the treatment effect was neutral between both strategies. Sex interaction with treatment strategy was evident in the Western trial (Pinteraction =0.019) but not in the Asian trials (PRECOMBAT Pinteraction =0.469 and BEST Pinteraction =0.472; I(2)=58%). The present meta-analysis suggested the presence of the heterogeneous sex - treatment interaction across Asian and Western trials. Considering the ongoing globalization of our medical practice, the heterogeneity of the sex - treatment interaction needs to be well recognized and taken into account during the decision making of the treatment strategy.

Hypofunctional occlusion of the maxillary first molar (M1) of the H and HL groups was induced by the bite-raising technique. Only the HL group was irradiated with LIPUS for 5 days. The IRAB and PDL of M1 were examined by microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) analysis. To quantify mRNA expression of cytokines involved in PDL proliferation and development, real-time reverse transcription quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed for twist family bHLH transcription factor 1 (Twist1), periostin, and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in the PDL samples. Micro-CT analysis showed that the PDL volume was decreased in the H group compared with that of the C and HL groups. Both bone volume per tissue volume (BV / TV) of IRAB was decreased in the H group compared with that in the C group.

      "document": "Novel Strategy to Expand Super-Charged NK Cells with Significant Potential to Lyse and Differentiate Cancer Stem Cells: Differences in NK Expansion and Function between Healthy and Cancer Patients Natural killer (NK) cells are known to target cancer stem cells and undifferentiated tumors. In this paper, we provide a novel strategy for expanding large numbers of super-charged NK cells with significant potential to lyse and differentiate cancer stem cells and demonstrate the differences in the dynamics of NK cell expansion between healthy donors and cancer patients. Decline in cytotoxicity and lower interferon (IFN)-γ secretion by osteoclast (OC)-expanded NK cells from cancer patients correlates with faster expansion of residual contaminating T cells within purified NK cells, whereas healthy donors ' OCs continue expanding super-charged NK cells while limiting T cell expansion for up to 60 days. Similar to patient NK cells, NK cells from tumor -bearing BLT-humanized mice promote faster expansion of residual T cells resulting in decreased numbers and function of NK cells, whereas NK cells from mice with no tumor continue expanding NK cells and retain their cytotoxicity. In addition, dendritic cells (DCs) in contrast to OCs are found to promote faster expansion of residual T cells within purified NK cells resulting in the decline in NK cell numbers from healthy individuals. Addition of anti-CD3 mAb inhibits T cell proliferation while enhancing NK cell expansion; however, expanding NK cells have lower cytotoxicity but higher secretion of IFN-γ. Expansion and functional activation of super-charged NK cells by OCs is dependent on interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-15. Thus, in this report, we not only provide a novel strategy to expand super-charged NK cells, but also demonstrate that rapid and sustained expansion of residual T cells within the purified NK cells during expansion with DCs or OCs could be a potential mechanism by which the numbers and function of NK cells decline in cancer patients and in BLT-humanized mice.",

      "document": "Intranasal Insulin Prevents Anesthesia - Induced Cognitive Impairment and Chronic Neurobehavioral Changes General anesthesia increases the risk for cognitive impairment post operation, especially in the elderly and vulnerable individuals. Recent animal studies on the impact of anesthesia on postoperative cognitive impairment have provided some valuable insights, but much remains to be understood. Here, by using mice of various ages and conditions, we found that anesthesia with propofol and sevoflurane caused significant deficits in spatial learning and memory, as tested using Morris Water Maze (MWM) 2-6 days after anesthesia exposure, in aged (17-18 months old) wild-type (WT) mice and in adult (7-8 months old) 3xTg-AD mice (a triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD)), but not in adult WT mice. Anesthesia resulted in long-term neurobehavioral changes in the fear conditioning task carried out 65 days after exposure to anesthesia in 3xTg-AD mice. Importantly, daily intranasal administration of insulin (1.75 U/ mouse / day) for only 3 days prior to anesthesia completely prevented the anesthesia - induced deficits in spatial learning and memory and the long-term neurobehavioral changes tested 65 days after exposure to anesthesia in 3xTg-AD mice. These results indicate that aging and AD -like brain pathology increase the vulnerability to cognitive impairment after anesthesia and that intranasal treatment with insulin can prevent anesthesia - induced cognitive impairment.",

      "document": "Serotonin and Serotonin Transporters in the Adrenal Medulla: A Potential Hub for Modulation of the Sympathetic Stress Response Serotonin (5-HT) is an important neurotransmitter in the central nervous system where it modulates circuits involved in mood, cognition, movement, arousal, and autonomic function. The 5-HT transporter (SERT; SLC6A4) is a key regulator of 5-HT signaling, and genetic variations in SERT are associated with various disorders including depression, anxiety, and autism. This review focuses on the role of SERT in the sympathetic nervous system. Autonomic / sympathetic dysfunction is evident in patients with depression, anxiety, and other diseases linked to serotonergic signaling. Experimentally, loss of SERT function (SERT knockout mice or chronic pharmacological block) has been reported to augment the sympathetic stress response. Alterations to serotonergic signaling in the CNS and thus central drive to the peripheral sympathetic nervous system are presumed to underlie this augmentation. Although less widely recognized, SERT is robustly expressed in chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla, the neuroendocrine arm of the sympathetic nervous system. Adrenal chromaffin cells do not synthesize 5-HT but accumulate small amounts by SERT -mediated uptake. Recent evidence demonstrated that 5-HT1A receptors inhibit catecholamine secretion from adrenal chromaffin cells via an atypical mechanism that does not involve modulation of cellular excitability or voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels. This raises the possibility that the adrenal medulla is a previously unrecognized peripheral hub for serotonergic control of the sympathetic stress response. As a framework for future investigation, a model is proposed in which stress - evoked adrenal catecholamine secretion is fine-tuned by SERT -modulated autocrine 5-HT signaling.",

      "document": "TRIB3 downregulation enhances doxorubicin - induced cytotoxicity in gastric cancer cells TRIB3, which is a pseudokinase known to regulate multiple pro-survival pathways, appears to be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of human tumors. However, its precise role in cancer is controversial, as TRIB3 protein levels have been associated with both good and poor prognosis in cancer patients. Here, we investigated the significance of TRIB3 expression in the survival of gastric cancer cells exposed to anticancer drugs. We found that the tested anticancer drug, doxorubicin, induced cytotoxicity by decreasing TRIB3 transcription, which was followed by apoptotic cell death. Moreover, TRIB3 siRNA knockdown appeared to enhance doxorubicin - induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells, concurrently with altering the expression of downstream apoptotic factors. Conversely, overexpression of TRIB3 significantly protected cells against doxorubicin - induced apoptosis. Our results indicate that downregulation of TRIB3 appears to promote cell death and enhance doxorubicin - induced apoptosis, supporting the anti-apoptotic role of TRIB3. The inductions of three classes of MAPKs failed to affect doxorubicin -mediated TRIB3 downregulation, while TRIB3 overexpression did not affect doxorubicin - induced MAPK activation. In sum, our findings indicate that TRIB3 plays an anti-apoptotic role in doxorubicin -treated gastric cancer cell lines, perhaps indicating that the status of TRIB3 expression in response to anticancer drugs, such as doxorubicin, irinotecan or oxaliplatin, may reflect the efficiency for cancer therapy.",

We investigated this relationship using 64-slice multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in patients with stable angina pectoris (SAP).Methods and Results:We enrolled 65 patients with SAP who underwent MDCT. Three monocyte subsets (CD14(++)CD16(-), CD14(++)CD16(+), and CD14(+)CD16(+)) and expression of TLR-4 were measured by flow cytometry. Intracoronary plaques were assessed by 64-slice MDCT. We defined vulnerability of intracoronary plaques according to the presence of positive remodeling (remodeling index >1.05) and/or low CT attenuation (<35 HU). The circulating CD14(++)CD16(+)monocytes more frequently expressed TLR-4 than CD14(++)CD16(-) and CD14(+)CD16(+)monocytes (P<0.001). The relative proportion of the expression of TLR-4 on CD14(++)CD16(+)monocytes was significantly greater in patients with vulnerable plaque compared with those without (10.4 [4.1-14.5] % vs. 4.5 [2.8-7.8] %, P=0.012). In addition, the relative proportion of TLR-4 expression on CD14(++)CD16(+)monocytes positively correlated with the remodeling index (r=0.28, P=0.025) and negatively correlated with CT attenuation value (r=-0.31, P=0.013). Upregulation of TLR-4 on CD14(++)CD16(+)monocytes might be associated with coronary plaque vulnerability in patients with SAP.",

Adult vascular risk factors and socioeconomic status (SES) are associated with increased risk, but less is known about early life risk factors, such as education, childhood SES, or intelligence (IQ). We comprehensively searched Medline, PsycINFO and EMBASE from inception to November 2015. We included all studies reporting data on >50 strokes examining childhood /premorbid IQ, SES, and education. Two reviewers independently screened full texts and extracted and cross-checked data, including available risk-factor adjustments. We meta-analyzed stroke risk using hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR) and mean differences (MD). We tested effects of study and participant characteristics in sensitivity analyses and meta-regression, and assessed heterogeneity and publication bias. We identified 90 studies examining stroke risk and education (79), SES (10), or IQ (nine) including approximately 161,001 stroke and over 5 million stroke-free participants. Stroke risk increased with lower education (OR =1.35, 95% CI =1.24 to 1.48), SES (OR =1.28, 95% CI =1.12 to 1.46) and IQ (HR =1.17, 95% CI =1.00 to 1.37) in studies reporting point estimates, with similar associations for MD. We found minimal publication bias. Between-study heterogeneity was partly explained by participant age and case ascertainment method. Education, childhood SES and intelligence have modest but important associations with lifetime stroke, and hence dementia, risks. Future studies distinguishing between the individual and combined effects of education, childhood SES and intelligence are needed to determine the independent contribution of each factor to stroke risk.",

This development of these checkpoint inhibitors has greatly influenced our approach to the treatment of lung cancer in first and second line. The limited toxicity profile and the ability to treat for prolonged periods, even in smokers, is a welcome expansion of the therapeutic arsenal of the oncologist. Areas covered: This review highlights the results of recent clinical trials on pembrolizumab for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. The authors discuss both first and second line treatment with pembrolizumab as monotherapy and in combination therapies. Additionally, implications of the PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assay with the 22C3 antibody and its use in clinical practice and trials is discussed. Expert commentary: A higher overall response, overall survival and a moderate toxicity profile is observed with the use of pembrolizumab, compared to chemotherapy, in both first and second line. These promising results have already translated into the registration of pembrolizumab in first and second line in patients with a high expression of PD-L1. However, as PD-L1 staining does not sufficiently discriminate responders from non-responders for all checkpoint inhibitors, there still is a need for a better predictive biomarker.",

      "document": "Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS)- induced Sertoli cell injury through a disruption of F-actin and microtubule organization is mediated by Akt1 / 2 PFOS (perfluorooctanesulfonate, or perfluorooctane sulfonic acid) is an anthropogenic fluorosurfactant widely used in consumer products. While its use in Europe, Canada and the U.S. has been banned due to its human toxicity, it continues to be used in China and other developing countries as a global pollutant. Herein, using an in vitro model of Sertoli cell blood-testis barrier (BTB), PFOS was found to induce Sertoli cell injury by perturbing actin cytoskeleton through changes in the spatial expression of actin regulatory proteins. Specifically, PFOS caused mis-localization of Arp3 (actin-related protein 3, a branched actin polymerization protein) and palladin (an actin bundling protein). These disruptive changes thus led to a dis-organization of F-actin across Sertoli cell cytosol, causing truncation of actin microfilament, thereby failing to support the Sertoli cell morphology and adhesion protein complexes (e.g., occludin - ZO-1, CAR - ZO-1, and N-cadherin - ß-catenin), through a down-regulation of p-Akt1-S473 and p-Akt2-S474. The use of SC79, an Akt1 / 2 inhibitor, was found to block the PFOS - induced Sertoli cell injury by rescuing the PFOS - induced F-actin dis-organization. These findings thus illustrate PFOS exerts its disruptive effects on Sertoli cell function downstream through Akt1 / 2. As such, PFOS - induced male reproductive dysfunction can possibly be managed through an intervention on Akt1 / 2 expression.",

      "document": "Simultaneous Bilateral Cataract Surgery in Outreach Surgical Camps The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and visual outcomes of simultaneous bilateral cataract surgery (SBCS) with intraocular lens implantation performed in outreach surgical eye camps. The medical records of 47 consecutive patients who underwent simultaneous bilateral small-incision cataract surgery between January 2010 and December 2015 in outreach surgical camps in rural Cameroon were reviewed. The measures included postoperative visual outcomes and intraoperative and postoperative complications. Data from 94 eyes of 47 participants (30 men, 17 women; mean age: 60.93 ± 13.58 years, range: 45-80 years) were included in this study. The presented best visual acuity (VA) was less than 3/60 in 100% of the eyes. At the 4- week follow-up, 84.04% of the eyes showed increased VA of 1 line or more (P = .001). Of these, 71 (75.53%) achieved good VA (greater than 6/18). Intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred in 19 (20.21%) eyes. The most serious intraoperative complication was a posterior capsule rupture and vitreous loss (2 patients, 2 eyes). The postoperative complications included a transient elevation in the intraocular pressure (6 eyes), chronic corneal oedema (5 eyes), iris capture (3 eyes), lens decentration (2 eyes), and hyphema (1 eye). No cases of postoperative endophthalmitis were recorded. Under the strict observation of endophthalmitis prophylaxis, SBCS is an option to reduce the cataract blindness backlog in rural areas of developing countries.",

      "document": "Hif-1α Overexpression Improves Transplanted Bone Mesenchymal Stem Cells Survival in Rat MCAO Stroke Model Bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) death after transplantation is a serious obstacle impacting on the outcome of cell therapy for cerebral infarction. This study was aimed to investigate whether modification of BMSCs with hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (Hif-1α) could enhance the survival of the implanted BMSCs. BMSCs were isolated from Wistar rats, and were infected with Hif-1α-GFP lentiviral vector or Hif-1α siRNA. The modified BMSCs were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) condition, cellular viability and apoptosis were then assessed. An inhibitor of AMPK (compound C) was used to detect whether AMPK and mTOR were implicated in the functions of Hif-1α on BMSCs survival. Besides, ultrastructure of BMSCs was observed and the expression of autophagy markers was measured. The modified BMSCs were transplanted into middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of rats, and the cerebral infarction volume and neurological function was assessed. The results indicated that Hif-1α overexpression protected OGD induced injury by promoting cellular viability and inhibiting apoptosis. AMPK was activated while mTOR was inactivated by Hif-1α overexpression, and that might be through which Hif-1α functioned BMSCs survival. Hif-1α overexpression promoted autophagy; more important, compound C abolished the induction of Hif-1α on autophagy. Transplantation of the overexpressed Hif-1α of BMSCs into the MCAO rats reduced brain infarct volume and improved neurobehavioral outcome; besides, it inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokines generation while promoted neurotrophin secretion. In conclusion, Hif-1α might be contributed in the survival of BMSCs by regulating the activation of AMPK and mTOR, as well as by promoting autophagy.",

      "document": "Meningitis due to Moraxella nonliquefaciens in a paediatric patient: a case report and review of the literature Introduction. Moraxella nonliquefaciens is an unusual organism to be isolated from cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and there exists only one case report of M. nonliquefaciens meningitis from a neonate. Moraxella species normally exist as part of the human upper respiratory tract flora and rarely cause invasive human disease. There are only a handful of case reports implicating the organism as a cause of endocarditis, bacteraemia, septic arthritis and endophthalmitis. Identification to the species level based on routine laboratory techniques has been challenging, with final identification often made through 16S rRNA sequencing. With the use of a newer diagnostic tool, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) MS, we were able to rapidly identify the organism and initiate appropriate treatment. Case presentation. We present a rare care of M. nonliquefaciens meningitis in a paediatric patient with an underlying cranial anatomical defect due to Crouzon syndrome. She had been admitted to hospital 3 months previously with Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis and mastoiditis, and returned to the emergency department with meningismus. CSF culture grew M. nonliquefaciens. She was treated with ceftriaxone with rapid improvement and eventually was taken for endoscopic surgical repair of a right encephalocele defect. Conclusion. The use of MALDI-TOF MS allowed for the rapid identification of the organism. The patient recovered with appropriate antimicrobial therapy and eventual surgical correction. An underlying anatomical defect should be considered in all patients who present with meningitis due to this unusual organism.",

      "document": "Skin Conductance Responses and Neural Activations During Fear Conditioning and Extinction Recall Across Anxiety Disorders The fear conditioning and extinction neurocircuitry has been extensively studied in healthy and clinical populations, with a particular focus on posttraumatic stress disorder. Despite significant overlap of symptoms between posttraumatic stress disorder and anxiety disorders, the latter has received less attention. Given that dysregulated fear levels characterize anxiety disorders, examining the neural correlates of fear and extinction learning may shed light on the pathogenesis of underlying anxiety disorders. To investigate the psychophysiological and neural correlates of fear conditioning and extinction recall in anxiety disorders and to document how these features differ as a function of multiple diagnoses or anxiety severity. This investigation was a cross-sectional, case-control, functional magnetic resonance imaging study at an academic medical center. Participants were healthy controls and individuals with at least 1 of the following anxiety disorders: generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, and panic disorder. The study dates were between March 2013 and May 2015. Two-day fear conditioning and extinction paradigm. Skin conductance responses, blood oxygenation level-dependent responses, trait anxiety scores from the State Trait Anxiety Inventory - Trait Form, and functiona l connectivity. This study included 21 healthy controls (10 women) and 61 individuals with anxiety disorders (36 women). P values reported for the neuroimaging results are all familywise error corrected. Skin conductance responses during extinction recall did not differ between individuals with anxiety disorders and healthy controls (ηp2 = 0.001, P = .79), where ηp2 is partial eta squared. The anxiety group had lower activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during extinction recall (ηp2 = 0.178, P = .02). A similar hypoactive pattern was found during early conditioning (ηp2 = 0.106, P = .009). The vmPFC hypoactivation was associated with anxiety symptom severity (r = -0.420, P = .01 for conditioning and r = -0.464, P = .004 for extinction recall) and the number of co-occuring anxiety disorders diagnosed (ηp2 = 0.137, P = .009 for conditioning and ηp2 = 0.227, P = .004 for extinction recall). Psychophysiological interaction analyses revealed that the fear network connectivity differed between healthy controls and the anxiety group during fear learning (ηp2 range between 0.088 and 0.176 and P range between 0.02 and 0.003) and extinction recall (ηp2 range between 0.111 and 0.235 and P range between 0.02 and 0.002). Despite no skin conductance response group differences during extinction recall, brain activation patterns between anxious and healthy individuals differed. These findings encourage future studies to examine the conditions longitudinally and in the context of treatment trials to improve and guide therapeutics via advanced neurobiological understanding of each disorder.",

In 64% (122/191) of the clinically healthy Labrador retrievers, hepatic histology revealed inflammatory infiltrates. This frequency might be biased because part of them was included as first-line relatives of dogs with copper-associated hepatitis. Sensitivity of ALT, ALP, and BA in this population for detecting acute hepatitis was 45, 15, and 15%, respectively. For chronic hepatitis, sensitivity was 71, 35, and 13%, respectively. Specificity of ALT, ALP, and BA was >90% for AH, CH, and RH. When increased liver enzymes were present, median ALT was significantly higher in PH cases (312 U/L, range 38-1,369) compared to RH cases (91 U/L, range 39-139) (P < .001). There was no difference in ALP between dogs with a PH and a RH (P = .361). Histopathologic abnormalities in the liver were present in the majority of apparent clinically healthy Labrador retrievers.

      "document": "Galectin-3 is a target for proteases involved in the virulence of Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of skin and soft-tissue infection. The bacterium expresses four major proteases emerging as virulence factors; aureolysin (Aur), V8 protease (SspA), staphopain A (ScpA), and staphopain B (SspB). We hypothesized that human galectin-3, a β-galactoside-binding lectin involved in immune regulation and antimicrobial defense, is a target for these proteases, and that proteolysis of galectin-3 is a novel immune evasion mechanism. Indeed, supernatants from laboratory strains and clinical isolates of S. aureus caused galectin-3 degradation. Similar proteolytic capacity was found in Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates, but not Staphylococcus saprophyticus Galectin-3 -induced activation of the neutrophil NADPH-oxidase was abrogated by bacteria -derived proteolysis of galectin-3, and SspB was identified as the major protease responsible. The impact of galectin-3 and protease expression on S. aureus virulence was studied in a murine skin infection model. In galectin-3(+/+) mice, SspB - expressing S. aureus caused larger lesions and higher bacterial load than protease-lacking bacteria. No such difference was detected in galectin-3(-/-) mice, which also showed smaller lesion size as compared to the galectin-3(+/+) animals. In conclusion, the staphylococcal protease SspB inactivates galectin-3, abrogating its stimulation of oxygen radical production in human neutrophils and increasing tissue damage during skin infection.",

      "document": "Tenofovir alafenamide versus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for the treatment of HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B virus infection: a randomised, double-blind, phase 3, non-inferiority trial Tenofovir alafenamide is a novel prodrug formulated to deliver the active metabolite to target cells more efficiently than tenofovir disoproxil fumarate at a lower dose, thereby reducing systemic exposure. In patients with HIV, tenofovir alafenamide was as efficacious as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, with reduced bone and renal toxic effects. We compared the efficacy and safety of the two drugs in patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a non-inferiority study. We did this ongoing double-blind, non-inferiority study in 161 outpatient centres in 19 countries. Patients with chronic HBV infection who were positive for the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either 25 mg tenofovir alafenamide or 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with matching placebo. Randomisation was done by a computer - generated allocation sequence (block size six) stratified by plasma HBV DNA concentration and previous treatment experience. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with HBV DNA less than 29 IU/mL at week 48 in all patients who were randomly assigned and received at least one dose of study drug using a missing-equals-failed approach. The pre-specified non-inferiority margin was 10%. Key prespecified safety endpoints were bone and renal parameters at week 48. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01940471. Of the 1473 patients screened from Sept 11, 2013, to Dec 20, 2014, 875 eligible patients were randomly assigned and 873 received treatment (581 with tenofovir alafenamide and 292 with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate). 371 (64%) patients receiving tenofovir alafenamide had HBV DNA less than 29 IU/mL at week 48, which was non-inferior to the 195 (67%) of patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate who had HBV DNA less than 29 IU/mL (adjusted difference -3·6% [95% CI -9·8 to 2·6]; p =0·25). Patients given tenofovir alafenamide had a significantly smaller decrease in bone mineral density at hip (mean change -0·10% [95% CI -0·29 to 0·09] vs -1·72% [-2·02 to -1·41]; adjusted difference 1·62 [1·27 to 1·96]; p <0·0001) and at spine (mean change -0·42% [-0·66 to -0·17] vs -2·29% [-2·67 to -1·92]; adjusted difference 1·88 [1·44 to 2·31]; p <0·0001) as well as smaller mean increases in serum creatinine at week 48 (0·01 mg/dL [0·00-0·02] vs 0·03 mg/dL [0·02-0·04]; p =0·02). The most common adverse events overall were upper respiratory tract infection (51 [9%] of 581 patients receiving tenofovir alafenamide vs 22 [8%] of 292 patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), nasopharyngitis (56 [10%] vs 16 [5%]), and headache (42 [7%] vs 22 [8%]). 22 (4%) patients receiving tenofovir alafenamide and 12 (4%) patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate experienced serious adverse events, none of which was deemed by the investigator to be related to study treatment. 187 (32%) of 581 patients in the tenofovir alafenamide group and 96 (33%) of 292 patients in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group had grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities, the most common of which were elevations in ALT (62 [11%] of 577 patients receiving tenofovir alafenamide and 36 [13%] of 288 patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) and AST (20 [3%] of 577 patients receiving tenofovir alafenamide and 19 [7%] of 288 patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate). In patients with HBeAg-positive HBV infection, tenofovir alafenamide was non-inferior to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and had improved bone and renal effects.

      "document": "Characterization and phylogenetic analysis of complete mitochondrial genomes for two desert cyprinodontoid fishes, Empetrichthys latos and Crenichthys baileyi The Pahrump poolfish (Empetrichthys latos) and White River springfish (Crenichthys baileyi) are small-bodied teleost fishes (order Cyprinodontiformes) endemic to the arid Great Basin and Mojave Desert regions of western North America. These taxa survive as small, isolated populations in remote streams and springs and evolved to tolerate extreme conditions of high temperature and low dissolved oxygen. Both species have experienced severe population declines over the last 50-60years that led to some subspecies being categorized with protected status under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Here we report the first sequencing of the complete mitochondrial DNA genomes for both E. l. latos and the moapae subspecies of C. baileyi. Complete mitogenomes of 16,546bp nucleotides were obtained from two E. l. latos individuals collected from introduced populations at Spring Mountain Ranch State Park and Shoshone Ponds Natural Area, Nevada, USA, while a single mitogenome of 16,537bp was sequenced for C. b. moapae. The mitogenomes of both species contain 13 protein - encoding genes, twenty-two tRNAs, and two rRNAs (12S and 18S) following the syntenic arrangement typical of Actinopterygiian fish mitogenomes, as well as D-loop control regions of 858bp for E. latos and 842bp for C. baileyi moapae. The two E. latos individuals exhibited only 0.0181% nucleotide sequence divergence across the entire mitogenome, implying little intraspecific mtDNA genetic variation. Comparative phylogenetic analysis of the poolfish and springfish mitochondrial genomes to available mitogenomes of other Cyprinodontoid fishes confirmed the close relationship of these oviparous Empetrichthys and Crenichthys genera to the viviparous goodeid fishes of central Mexico, and showed the combined clade of these fishes to be a sister group to the Profundulidae killifishes. Despite several significant life history and morphological differences between the Empetrichthyinae and Goodienae, estimates of evolutionary genetic distances using two partial regions of mtDNA point to inclusion of the Empetrichthys and Crenichthys genera within the family Goodeidae along with the goodeid fishes of central Mexico.",

Endothelial cells can use a number of different pathways to cause angiogenesis and each step in these pathways can be targeted. The use of multi targeted drugs is gaining much importance in this scenario. Our previous results have shown the anti angiogenic effect of Chebulagic acid - a benzopyran tannin present in the fruits of Terminalia chebula. The present study was designed to examine the molecular mechanism of the anti angiogenic effect of chebulagic acid. Results of our investigations using molecular docking studies and HUVECs in culture suggested that Chebulagic acid inhibited GSK-3β dependent β-catenin phosphorylation, an important mediator of VE-cadherin / β-catenin signaling and VEGFR2 phosphorylation which is an important step involved in VEGF signaling. Chebulagic acid inhibits angiogenesis by blocking both VEGF / VEGFR2 and cell-cell contact dependent downstream signaling pathway.",

Samples were extracted with acetonitrile and partitioned with dichloromethane. After partitioning, purification was conducted using a Florisil(®) cartridge. Linearity of a matrix-matched calibration curve of the two compounds over a concentration range of 0.004-0.4μg/g was excellent, with determination coefficients (R(2))≥0.9998. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) for both acetamiprid and thiacloprid were 0.0006 and 0.002mg/kg, respectively. The average recoveries for acetamiprid and thiacloprid at two spiking levels (0.02 and 0.1mg/kg, i.e., 10× LOQ and 50× LOQ) were between 78.23 to 82.17%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs)≤7.22%. The method was successfully applied to field-incurred samples treated with a commercial pesticide product, either once (zero or 7 days before harvest) or twice (0 and 7, 7 and 14, or 14 and 21 days before harvest). The highest and lowest residues were obtained for the 7 and 0 days ' treatment and the 21 and 14 days ' treatment, respectively. The developed method is simple and accurate and can be extrapolated to other leafy vegetables.",

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently recommended to adopt universal mupirocin / chlorhexidine decolonization of all admitted intensive care unit patients, rather than MRSA screening with targeted treatments, which raises the serious concern about the selection of resistance to mupirocin and chlorhexidine in strains of staphylococci. Thus, a simple, rapid, and reliable approach will be paramount in monitoring the resistance prevalence to these agents. We developed a simple multiplex PCR assay capable of screening Staphylococcus isolates for the presence of antiseptic resistance genes for chlorhexidine and quaternary ammonium compounds, as well as mupirocin - and methicillin-resistance genes, while simultaneously discriminating S. aureus from coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). The assay incorporates 7 PCR targets, including staph 16S-rRNA (specifically detecting Staphylococcus sp .), nuc (distinguishing S. aureus from CoNS), mecA (distinguishing MRSA from methicillin-susceptible S. aureus), mupA and mupB (identifying high-level mupirocin resistance), qac and smr (identifying chlorhexidine and quaternary ammonium resistance). Our assay demonstrated 100% sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in a total of 23 variant antiseptic / antibiotic-resistant control strains. Further validation of our assay using 378 randomly selected and previously well-characterized local clinical isolates confirmed its feasibility and practicality. This may prove to be a useful tool for multidrug-resistant staphylococci monitoring in clinical laboratories, particularly in the wake of increased chlorhexidine and mupirocin treatments.",

      "document": "Young people, mental health practitioners and researchers co-produce a Transition Preparation Programme to improve outcomes and experience for young people leaving Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) In the UK young people attending child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) are required to move on, either through discharge or referral to an adult service, at age 17/18, a period of increased risk for onset of mental health problems and other complex psychosocial and physical changes. CAMHS transitions are often poorly managed with negative outcomes for young people. Better preparation may improve outcomes and experience. This study aimed to co-produce, with young people who had transitioned or were facing transition from CAMHS, a CAMHS Transition Preparation Programme (TPP), deliverable in routine NHS settings. Eighteen young people, aged 17-22, from three UK National Health Service (NHS) mental health foundation trusts participated in creative, participatory research workshops. Seven parents completed short questionnaires. Thirty clinical staff from two trusts took part in workshops to ensure deliverability of young people's ideas. Young people were offered co-research opportunities. Most young people felt anxious, fearful and uncertain on leaving CAMHS and perceived mental health services as uncaring. Participants outlined transition procedures and drafted a range of preparation activities, centred around dedicated Transition Peer Support and a transition booklet, which should be offered to all CAMHS leavers, irrespective of discharge or transfer to an adult service. Preparation should aim to build confidence to help young people take responsibility for themselves and flourish in the adult world: coping or getting through it was not enough. Some clinicians also felt anxious at transition and recognised the potential impact on young people of poor communication and lack of understanding between services. Parents would appreciate help to support their offspring during the transition period. Clinicians cited lack of funding and inflexible NHS procedures and policies as potential barriers to the implementation of young people's ideas. Nine young people took up co-research opportunities. Mental health services underestimate the anxiety of CAMHS leavers. Young people have clear ideas about the preparation they require to leave CAMHS with the confidence to take responsibility for their own health care. Close collaboration of NHS staff and researchers facilitates the implementation of research findings.",

      "document": "Involvement of intracellular Zn(2+) signaling in LTP at perforant pathway - CA1 pyramidal cell synapse Physiological significance of synaptic Zn(2+) signaling was examined at perforant pathway - CA1 pyramidal cell synapses. In vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) at perforant pathway - CA1 pyramidal cell synapses was induced using a recording electrode attached to a microdialysis probe and the recording region was locally perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) via the microdialysis probe. Perforant pathway LTP was not attenuated under perfusion with CaEDTA (10 mM), an extracellular Zn(2+) chelator, but attenuated under perfusion with ZnAF-2DA (50 μM), an intracellular Zn(2+) chelator, suggesting that intracellular Zn(2+) signaling is required for perforant pathway LTP. Even in rat brain slices bathed in CaEDTA in ACSF, intracellular Zn(2+) level, which was measured with intracellular ZnAF-2, was increased in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare where perforant pathway - CA1 pyramidal cell synapses were contained after tetanic stimulation. These results suggest that intracellular Zn(2+) signaling, which originates in internal stores/ proteins, is involved in LTP at perforant pathway - CA1 pyramidal cell synapses. Because the influx of extracellular Zn(2+), which originates in presynaptic Zn(2+) release, is involved in LTP at Schaffer collateral - CA1 pyramidal cell synapses, synapse -dependent Zn(2+) dynamics may be involved in plasticity of postsynaptic CA1 pyramidal cells.",

      "document": "Ideal cardiovascular health and inflammation in European adolescents: The HELENA study Inflammation plays a key role in atherosclerosis and this process seems to appear in childhood. The ideal cardiovascular health index (ICHI) has been inversely related to atherosclerotic plaque in adults. However, evidence regarding inflammation and ICHI in adolescents is scarce. The aim is to assess the association between ICHI and inflammation in European adolescents. As many as 543 adolescents (251 boys and 292 girls) from the Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence (HELENA) study, a cross-sectional multi-center study including 9 European countries, were measured. C-reactive protein (CRP), complement factors C3 and C4, leptin and white blood cell counts were used to compute an inflammatory score. Multilevel linear models and multilevel logistic regression were used to assess the association between ICHI and inflammation controlling by covariates. Higher ICHI was associated with a lower inflammatory score, as well as with several individual components, both in boys and girls (p < 0.01). In addition, adolescents with at least 4 ideal components of the ICHI had significantly lower inflammatory score and lower levels of the study biomarkers, except CRP. Finally, the multilevel logistic regression showed that for every unit increase in the ICHI, the probability of having an inflammatory profile decreased by 28.1% in girls. Results from this study suggest that a better ICHI is associated with a lower inflammatory profile already in adolescence. Improving these health behaviors, and health factors included in the ICHI, could play an important role in CVD prevention.",

This review summarizes current knowledge of biological material (' sensors ') used for biomagnetic monitoring purposes. Our work addresses: the range of magnetic properties reported for lichens, mosses, leaves, bark, trunk wood, insects, crustaceans, mammal and human tissues; their associations with atmospheric pollutant species (PM, NOx, trace elements, PAHs); the pros and cons of biomagnetic monitoring of atmospheric pollution; current challenges for large-scale implementation of biomagnetic monitoring; and future perspectives. A summary table is presented, with the aim of aiding researchers and policy makers in selecting the most suitable biological sensor for their intended biomagnetic monitoring purpose.",

To determine pain control and side effects after gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for classical idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (TN) with or without neurovascular compression (NVC). This study included 47 patients with type 1 idiopathic TN and Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) pain class IV or V that were treated with GKRS, with maximal dose of 85 Gy targeting root entry zone, as a first-treatment modality between January 2005 and March 2015. A retrospective analysis was made of NVC status, pain control, side effects, recurrence, and cross-sectional area. During the median 21.5 months follow-up (range, 3-119 months), 36 (76.6%) patients showed good outcomes (improved to below BNI class IIIa). Twenty two patients did not show NVC (group A) and 25 had NVC present (group B). Good outcomes were not different in two groups (group A: 19/22; group B: 17/25)(p = 0.138). The numbers of cases in BNI class I or II, and recurrences were not different (p = 0.532, 0.786, respectively). The mean areas were 8.64 ± 2.59 mm3 in non-deviated cases (n = 27) and 2.59 ± 1.68 mm3 in deviated (n = 10). Side effects were significantly more frequent in deviated cases (8/10; 80%) than in non-deviated (7/27; 25.9%) (p = 0.003). NVC is not a predictive factor for pain control after GKRS for the treatment of idiopathic TN. Side effects may occur more frequently in patients with NVC at the target coordinate when a root entry zone is used, but the subjective symptoms are not always bothersome.",

      "document": "Complete study demonstrating the absence of rhabdovirus in a distinct Sf9 cell line A putative novel rhabdovirus (SfRV) was previously identified in a Spodoptera frugiperda cell line (Sf9 cells [ATCC CRL-1711 lot 58078522]) by next generation sequencing and extensive bioinformatic analysis. We performed an extensive analysis of our Sf9 cell bank (ATCC CRL-1711 lot 5814 [Sf9L5814]) to determine whether this virus was already present in cells obtained from ATCC in 1987. Inverse PCR of DNA isolated from Sf9 L5814 cellular DNA revealed integration of SfRV sequences in the cellular genome. RT-PCR of total RNA showed a deletion of 320 nucleotides in the SfRV RNA that includes the transcriptional motifs for genes X and L. Concentrated cell culture supernatant was analyzed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and revealed a single band at a density of 1.14 g/ml. This fraction was further analysed by electron microscopy and showed amorphous and particulate debris that did not resemble a rhabdovirus in morphology or size. SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed that the protein composition did not contain the typical five rhabdovirus structural proteins and LC-MS/MS analysis revealed primarily of exosomal marker proteins, the SfRV N protein, and truncated forms of SfRV N, P, and G proteins. The SfRV L gene fragment RNA sequence was recovered from the supernatant after ultracentrifugation of the 1.14 g/ml fraction treated with diethyl ether suggesting that the SfRV L gene fragment sequence is not associated with a diethyl ether resistant nucleocapsid. Interestingly, the 1.14 g/ml fraction was able to transfer baculovirus DNA into Sf9L5814 cells, consistent with the presence of functional exosomes. Our results demonstrate the absence of viral particles in ATCC CRL-1711 lot 5814 Sf9 cells in contrast to a previous study that suggested the presence of infectious rhabdoviral particles in Sf9 cells from a different lot. This study highlights how cell lines with different lineages may present different virosomes and therefore no general conclusions can be drawn across Sf9 cells from different laboratories.",

An amperometric H2O2 biosensor was constructed by immobilizing Hb NPs covalently onto a polycrystalline Au electrode (Au E). Hb NPs / Au E was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) before and after immobilization of Hb NPs. The Hb NPs / Au electrode showed optimum response within 2.5s at pH 6.5 in 0.1M sodium phosphate buffer containing 100μM H2O2 and 30⁰C, when operated at -0.2V against Ag/AgCl. The H bN Ps/ A uE exhibited Vmax of 5.161±0.1 μA cm(-2) with Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) of 0.1±0.01mM. The biosensor showed lower detection limit (1.0μM), high sensitivity (129±0.25μA cm(-2) mM(-1)) and wider linear range (1.0-1200μM) for H2O2 as compared to earlier biosensors. The analytical recoveries of added H2O2 in serum (0.5μM and1.0μM) were 97.77% and 98.01% respectively and within and between batch coefficients of variation (CV) were 3.16% and 3.36% respectively. There was a good correlation between sera H2O2 values obtained by standard enzymic colourimetric method and the present biosensor (R(2)=0.99). The biosensor measured H2O2 level in sera of apparently healthy subjects and persons suffering from diabetes type II. The Hb NPs / Au electrode lost 10% of its initial activity after 90 days of its regular uses, when stored dry at 4(o)C.",

      "document": "A quantitative method for the assessment of dysarthrophonia in myasthenia gravis Speech and voice symptomatology (dysarthrophonia) are often reported by patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). However, they have been poorly investigated despite their significant impact on quality of life. Quantitative methods for the assessment of dysarthrοphonia could facilitate the evaluation of these common MG symptoms. The goal of this study was to investigate the phonatory (sustained phonation and reading) and speech (diadochokinesis) function in MG patients using quantitative measures. The voice / speech of 12 MG patients (7 with anti-AchR and 5 with anti-MuSK antibodies) and 24 age-matched healthy controls was recorded and analyzed using electroglottography (EGG) and speech acoustics. For the analysis of voice, the variables that were found to distinguish MG patients compared to healthy controls were a higher average fundamental frequency (P<0.05), a higher standard deviation of the average fundamental frequency (P<0.001), a higher mean fundamental frequency of the vibrating vocal folds (P<0.005) and a higher fundamental frequency range (P<0.005). The analysis of diadochokinesis showed that MG patients had a higher mean duration of the silent interval between a series of repetitive /pa/ syllables (P<0.05), of the sound /t/ (P=0.05) and of the silent interval between a series of repetitive /ka/syllables (P<0.05). No statistical differences were found in any of these variables between the MG subgroups with anti-AchR or anti-MuSK antibodies. This study demonstrates that non-invasive physiological methods (EGG and speech acoustics) offer essential tools for the assessment of dysarthrophonia in MG patients.",

We analyzed family dietary intake according to the head of household's perception of satisfaction with food consumed by the family. Households (n = 13,351) that participated in the Brazilian Household Budget Survey and the National Dietary Survey were classified as satisfied or dissatisfied with the food consumed in the home. We compared the family dietary intake of the two groups considering their socio-demographic characteristics. Satisfied families (n = 4429) reported statistically higher intake (in grams/1000 kcal) of vegetables (47.3 vs 33.7), fruits (46.9 vs 21.4), sugar-sweetened beverages (118 vs 71.7), milk and dairy (57.9 vs 34.6), and ultra-processed products (18.6 vs 9.8); and lower intake of rice (86.2 vs 112), beans (91.7 vs 136), and meat (76.5 vs 84.0) when compared to dissatisfied families (n = 1717). Among satisfied families, in the youngest group we found lower consumption of fruits and higher intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and ultra-processed products when compared to the oldest group. Also among satisfied families, those in the highest per capita income group presented higher intake of fruits and lower intake of beans than those in the lowest income group. Satisfied families in the highest income group also consumed more fruits and less beans than dissatisfied families in the same income group. Socio-demographic characteristics may influence perception of satisfaction with food consumed and potentially influence the success of public health efforts to offer nutrition guidance for families satisfied with diets that may or may not be comprised of healthy food and beverages.",

      "document": "Estrogen deficiency accelerates lumbar facet joints arthritis Dramatic increase in the prevalence of lumbar facet joint (LFJ) arthritis in women around the age of menopause indicates a protective role for estrogen in LFJ arthritis. To date, there is no evidence for this indication and the mechanism of such an effect remains poorly understood. In this study, ovariectomized (OVX) mice were used to mimic the estrogen - deficient status of post-menopausal women. Micro-CT and immunohistochemistry was employed to assess the morphological and molecular changes in ovariectomy - induced LFJ arthritis. The results show that the LFJ subchondral bone mass was significantly decreased in OVX mice, with increased cavities on the interface of the subchondral bone. Severe cartilage degradation was observed in ovariectomy - induced LFJ arthritis. Increased blood vessels and innervations were also found in degenerated LFJ, particularly in the subchondral bone area. 17β-Estradiol treatment efficiently suppressed LFJ subchondral bone turnover, markedly inhibited cartilage degradation, and increased blood vessel and nerve ending growth in degenerated LFJ in OVX mice. Our study reveals that estrogen is a key factor in regulating LFJ metabolism. Severe LFJ degeneration occurs when estrogen is absent in vivo. Collapsed subchondral bone may be the initiation of this process, and estrogen replacement therapy can effectively prevent degeneration of LFJ under estrogen - deficient conditions.",

Therefore, our study investigated the influence of plasmatic nucleic acids on coagulation in septic patients in comparison to patients after major abdominal surgery. A total of 15 patients with sepsis, 10 postoperative patients, and 10 healthy volunteers were included in this longitudinal study. Blood was collected at sepsis onset and after surgery respectively, as well as after 24, 72 and 168 h. Levels of cfDNA and exRNA were measured by quantitative probe-based polymerase chain reaction. In addition, thromboelastography for coagulation as well as thromboaggregometry for platelet function was conducted. Both cfDNA and exRNA were elevated in patients with sepsis compared with postoperative patients and healthy volunteers. While higher exRNA levels correlated with a faster clotting time and more stable clots, cfDNA correlated with a shorter clotting time but also less fibrinolysis. In addition, higher cfDNA seems to be associated with kidney dysfunction as well as with general markers of cell damage (lactate dehydrogenase and lactate). Both nucleic acid species might be associated with different effects on coagulation during sepsis, with an overall procoagulatory influence. For this reason, individualized therapeutic approaches in patients suffering from coagulation - associated organ dysfunction might be feasible.",

      "document": "Vaccination of piglets at 2 and 3 weeks of age with Ingelvac PRRSFLEX® EU provides protection against heterologous field challenge in the face of homologous maternally derived antibodies Due to difficulties in eradicating porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) linked to biosecurity challenges, transmission of the virus and the lack of efficient DIVA vaccines, successful control of PRRS requires a combination of strict management measures and vaccination of both sows and piglets. The present study aimed to assess the efficacy of a recently developed MLV vaccine (Ingelvac PRRSFLEX® EU) in piglets at 2 and 3-weeks of age in the presence of homologous maternally derived antibodies as the dams were vaccinated with the same vaccine strain (ReproCyc® PRRS EU). The study was carried out on a Hungarian farrow to finish farm naturally infected with PRRSv. The study was designed as a blind, placebo controlled side by side trial. ORF5 sequence similarity of the vaccine strain and the resident field strain was 87.8 %. PRRS specific real-time quantitative PCR was performed from serum samples to measure both the viral load and the frequency of virus positive animals. At the time of the natural infection observed in the control group at 10-12 weeks of age, the number of viraemic animals did not increase significantly in the vaccinated group. To understand the infection dynamics, positive PCR samples with low Ct values were sequenced (ORF5) and the data analysis indicated the circulation of wild type virus in both groups, however wild type virus was only found in non-vaccinated animals. Our data indicate that piglets vaccinated at as early as 2 weeks of age with Ingelvac PRRSFLEX® EU were protected both in terms of proportion of viraemic animals and viraemia levels. It has to be highlighted that these results were achieved in piglets with high levels of homologous maternally derived antibodies (MDA) at the time of vaccination.",

      "document": "Neurokinin 3 Receptor Antagonism Reveals Roles for Neurokinin B in the Regulation of Gonadotropin Secretion and Hot Flashes in Postmenopausal Women Neurokinin B (NKB) and kisspeptin are obligate for normal gonadotropin secretion, and links between GnRH pulsatility and vasomotor symptoms have been proposed. Using a selective NKB receptor (NK3R) antagonist, the role of NKB in the hypergonadotropic state in menopausal women was explored. Eleven postmenopausal women were administered the NK3R antagonist MLE4901, 40 mg twice daily orally for 7 days. 10- min blood sampling for 8 h was performed before and on the last day of NK3R antagonist treatment for LH pulsatility analysis with kisspeptin-10 (0.3 µg/kg iv bolus) administered at 6 h on both days. Hot flash frequency and severity were self-reported for 7 days before and during NK3R antagonist administration. LH fell from 29.3 ± 4.1 to 24.4 ± 3.8 IU/l (p < 0.05) after 7 days of NK3R antagonist, with no change in FSH. Basal (nonpulsatile) LH secretion was reduced (549.0 ± 70.8 vs. 366.1 ± 92.1 IU/L/6 h, p = 0.006) and while LH pulse frequency did not change in the group as a whole (0.8 ± 0.1 to 0.7 ± 0.1 pulses /h, ns), it did fall in the 8/11 women with hot flashes, (1.0 ± 0.1 to 0.7 ± 0.1 pulses /h, p < 0.05). These women also reported a reduction in hot flash frequency (3.4 ± 1.2 to 1.0 ± 0.6 hot flashes / day, p = 0.008) whist taking NK3R antagonist. Kisspeptin-10 did not affect LH secretion with or without NK3R antagonist. The administration of a NK3R antagonist indicates a role for NKB in the regulation of LH / GnRH in postmenopausal women whereas the lack of response to kisspeptin may reflect the hypoestrogenic state. These data support a link between LH / GnRH pulsatility and vasomotor symptoms and NK3R antagonism as a potential therapeutic approach.",

      "document": "Propranolol Effects on Decompression Sickness in a Simulated DISSUB Rescue in Swine Disabled submarine (DISSUB) survivors may face elevated CO2 levels and inert gas saturation, putting them at risk for CO2 toxicity and decompression sickness (DCS). Propranolol was shown to reduce CO2 production in an experimental DISSUB model in humans but its effects on DCS in a DISSUB rescue scenario are unknown. A 100% oxygen prebreathe (OPB) reduces DCS incidence and severity and is incorporated into some DISSUB rescue protocols. We used a swine model of DISSUB rescue to study the effect of propranolol on DCS incidence and mortality with and without an OPB. In Experiment 1, male Yorkshire Swine (70 kg) were pressurized to 2.8 ATA for 22 h. Propranolol 1.0 mg · kg-1 (IV) was administered at 21.25 h. At 22 h, the animal was rapidly decompressed and observed for DCS type, onset time, and mortality. Experimental animals (N = 21; 69 ± 4.1 kg), PROP1.0, were compared to PROP1.0 - OPB45 (N = 8; 69 ± 2.8 kg) with the same dive profile, except for a 45 min OPB prior to decompression. In Experiment 2, the same methodology was used with the following changes: swine pressurized to 2.8 ATA for 28 h; experimental group (N = 25; 67 ± 3.3 kg), PROP0.5 bis, propranolol 0.5 mg · kg-1 bis (twice) (IV) was administered at 22 h and 26 h. Control animals (N = 25; 67 ± 3.9 kg) received normal saline. OPB reduced mortality in PROP1.0 - OBP45 compared to PROP1.0 (0% vs. 71%). PROP0.5 bis had increased mortality compared to CONTROL (60-% vs. 4%). Administration of beta blockers prior to saturation decompression appears to increase DCS and worsen mortality in a swine model; however, their effects in bounce diving remain unknown.Forbes AS, Regis DP, HallAA, Mahon RT, Cronin WA.

The effects of environmental pollution with aromatic hydrocarbons on the angiogenesis and elements of the mesenchymal tissue of the human placenta The literature presents only few reports regarding the effects of elevated levels of aromatic hydrocarbons (AH) on the functions of the human placenta. The effects of environmental contamination with AH (including phenol and 1-hydroxypyrene) have certain negative effects on parenchymal organs such as human placenta. The paper aimed to assess the effects of elevated levels of AH on the placental angiogenesis and elements of the mesenchymal tissue of the placenta. Tissue material from 50 afterbirths from Płock constituted a study group, whereas 50 afterbirths from Kutno constituted a control group. Immunohistochemical reactions with the peroxidase method using LSAB kits (DAKO) were performed. The extent and intensity of reactions were analysed. The levels of phenols and 1-hydroxypyrene in the excreted urine of pregnant women (undergoing delivery) were detected using gas chromatography and colorimetry. The levels of phenol and 1-hydroxypyrene in the excreted urine were demonstrated to be statistically significantly higher in patients living in the area of Płock. Statistically significantly higher expression of antibodies indicating placental angiogenesis was observed in the placentas in the Płock group (p < 0.01). Moreover, lower expression of vimentin indicating reactions with proteins in mesenchymal cells was observed in the Kutno group (p < 0.01). Pregnancy in the environment with elevated levels of aromatic hydrocarbons has detrimental effects on the human placenta. The foetus is protected by activation of adaptation and compensation mechanisms that are manifested as significant angiogenesis and greater development and differentiation of mesenchymal cells compared to the control group.",

In the present study, the effects of E. angustifolia fruit extract on the acute and chronic phases of formalin - induced rat paw edema were examined. The acute and chronic anti-inflammatory effects of E. angustifolia fruit extract were investigated through the subcutaneous injection of 100 μL of formalin (2.5%) into a rat's hind paw. Thirty minutes before the procedure, the experimental groups were treated intraperitoneally with hydroalcoholic fruit extracts of E. angustifolia (concentrations of 100, 300, 700, and 1000 mg/kg); sodium salicylate (SS, 400 mg/kg) and distilled water were used as positive and negative control groups, respectively. Treatment with SS and the fruit extracts were performed daily for 8 days, and the degree of edema was measured by using mercury plethysmometer and digital caliper. In the acute anti-inflammatory study, the extract showed a significant anti-inflammatory effect in a dose-dependent manner. The results of 1000 mg/kg of the extract was significantly different compared with the negative control group (p<0.05) and was comparable to sodium salicylate (p<0.05). Results from the chronic study suggested that E. angustifolia extract significantly reduced paw edema and inflammation in a dose-dependent manner. The results also showed that the measurement by digital caliper and mercury plethysmometer were both reliable and might be applied interchangeably (p<0.01). Phytochemical tests indicated that the hydroalcoholic fruit extract of E. angustifolia was positive for cardiac glycosides, flavonoids, terpenoids, and saponins. Based on our findings, the E. angustifolia fruit extract probably has acute and chronic anti-inflammatory activities to support its applications in folk medicine.",

      "document": "Interbacterial Adhesion Networks within Early Oral Biofilms of Single Human Hosts Specific interbacterial adhesion, termed coaggregation, is well established for three early colonizers of the plaque biofilm: streptococci, actinomyces, and veillonellae. However, little is known about interactions of other early colonizers and about the extent of interactions within the bacterial community from a single host. To address these gaps, subject - specific culture collections from two individuals were established using an intraoral biofilm retrieval device. Molecular taxonomy (Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray [HOMIM]) analysis of biofilm samples confirmed the integrity and completeness of the collections. HOMIM analysis verified the isolation of Streptococcus gordonii and S. anginosus from only one subject, as well as isolation of a previously uncultivated streptococcal phylotype from the other subject. Strains representative of clonal diversity within each collection were further characterized. Greater than 70% of these streptococcal strains from each subject coaggregated with at least one other coisolate. One-third of the strains carry a known coaggregation mediator: receptor polysaccharide (RPS). Almost all nonstreptococcal isolates coaggregated with other coisolates. Importantly, certain Rothia strains demonstrated more coaggregations with their coisolated bacteria than did any Streptococcus or Actinomyces strain, and certain Haemophilus isolates participated in twice as many. Confocal microscopy of undisturbed biofilms showed that Rothia and Haemophilus each occur in small multispecies microcolonies. However, in confluent high - biomass regions, Rothia occurred in islands whereas Haemophilus was distributed throughout. Together, the data demonstrate that coaggregation networks within an individual's oral microflora are extensive and that Rothia and Haemophilus can be important initiators of cell-cell interactions in the early biofilm .IMPORTANCE Extensive involvement of specific interbacterial adhesion in dental plaque biofilm formation has been postulated based on in vitro coaggregation between oral bacteria from culture collections that are not subject specific. In the present study, subject - specific culture collections were obtained from early plaque biofilm of two volunteers, and coaggregations within each culture collection were assayed. Coaggregations, several of which involved a coaggregation -mediating cell surface molecule known from well-studied streptococci, were widespread. Unexpectedly, the little-studied organisms Haemophilus and Rothia participated in the greatest numbers of interactions with community members; these two organisms showed different distributions within the undisturbed biofilm. The data show that coaggregation networks encompass most organisms within the biofilm community of each individual, and they indicate prominent participation of organisms such as Haemophilus and Rothia in early plaque biofilm formation.",

      "document": "A bio-cultural approach to the study of food choice: The contribution of taste genetics, population and culture The study of food choice, one of the most complex human traits, requires an integrated approach that takes into account environmental, socio-cultural and biological diversity. We recruited 183 volunteers from four geo-linguistic groups and highly diversified in terms of both genetic background and food habits from whom we collected genotypes and phenotypes tightly linked to taste perception. We confirmed previous genetic associations, in particular with stevioside perception, and noted significant differences in food consumption: in particular, broccoli, mustard and beer consumption scores were significantly higher (Adjusted P = 0.02, Adjusted P < 0.0001 and Adjusted P = 0.01, respectively) in North Europeans, when compared to the other groups. Licorice and Parmesan cheese showed lower consumption and liking scores in the Sri Lankan group (Adjusted P = 0.001 and Adjusted P < 0.001, respectively). We also highlighted how rs860170 (TAS2R16) strongly differentiated populations and was associated to salicin bitterness perception. Identifying genetic variants on chemosensory receptors that vary across populations and show associations with taste perception and food habits represents a step towards a better comprehension of this complex trait, aimed at improving the individual health status. This is the first study that concurrently explores the contribution of genetics, population diversity and cultural aspects in taste perception and food consumption.",

On the other side of protein homeostasis lies nephrotic syndrome. It is a well-known quantitative defect due to significant proteinuria. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a special congenital variant affecting children and adults. Hereby, we describe a three- year old male child who presented with generalized edema and global developmental delay. Investigations revealed PKU along with FSGS.

      "document": "A sensitive method for the determination of Sulfonamides in seawater samples by Solid Phase Extraction and UV-Visible spectrophotometry The authors have developed a sensitive spectrophotometric method for determination of sulfonamide derivatives such as sulfanilamide (SAA), sulfadiazine (SDZ), sulfacetamide (SCT) sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfamerazine (SMR), sulfadimethoxine (SDX), sulfamethiazole (SMT) and Sulfathiazole (STZ). This method is based on the Bratton-Marshall reaction, which involves the diazotization of sulfonamides with sodium nitrite under acidic conditions, followed by coupling with N-(1-naphtyl) ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (NED) to form a pink colored compound. Therefore, the Bratton-Marshall method was modified by optimizing the reaction conditions, which allows us to determine a low concentration range of sulfonamides compared to the reported methods. The limits of detection and quantification obtained were 0.019-0.05 and 0.06-0.16μgmL(-1), respectively. In comparison with other reported methods using different coupling agents, the proposed method was found to be the most simple and sensitive for sulfonamides determination. In this paper, the modified method was successfully employed for the determination of sulfonamides in drinking water, seawater and pharmaceutical and veterinary formulations. The purpose of this work is to optimize and develop a simple method for extraction and concentration of sulfonamides present as residues in seawater and their quantification with the recommended spectrophotometric method. Solid phase extraction (SPE) of sulfonamides from seawater samples was evaluated using Oasis HLB cartridges (3mL, 540mg). The recovery efficiency was investigated in the sulfonamides concentration range comprised between 0.19 and 126ngmL(-1). The ease of use of this extraction method makes it very useful for routine laboratory work.",

The aim of this study was to explore the presence of CSF-1 and IL-34 in whole saliva in relation to periodontal disease. Protocol validation was assessed in saliva of healthy donors (n=21) by ELISA. Salivary CSF-1, IL-34, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8, a biomarker candidate of periodontitis, were determined in 48 patients (29 periodontitis, 12 gingivitis, 7 healthy) and related to the clinical periodontal parameters bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment loss (AL), and plaque index (PI). An additional separate group of gingivitis (n=21) and part of periodontitis patients (n=11) were subjected to non-surgical periodontal treatment whereupon changes in salivary CSF-1, IL-34, and MMP-8 levels were determined and related to periodontal outcome. Periodontitis patients displayed higher CSF-1 and MMP-8 levels in saliva compared to healthy, while IL-34 levels were lower. Higher CSF-1 / IL-34 ratio was observed in periodontitis patients compared to healthy. There was a positive correlation between CSF-1 and MMP-8 which both correlated negatively to IL-34, in gingivitis and periodontitis. Clinical periodontal parameters correlated positively to CSF-1, MMP-8, and to the CSF-1 / IL-34 ratio and negatively to IL-34 in periodontitis patients. Following treatment CSF-1 and MMP-8 levels decreased along with clinical improvement in gingivitis patients. CSF-1 and IL-34 are present in saliva and seem to have complementary roles in periodontal disease, IL-34 in steady-state and CSF-1 in inflammation.",

      "document": "Intra-articular implantation of collagen scaffold carriers is safe in both native and arthrofibrotic rabbit knee joints Sustained intra-articular delivery of pharmacological agents is an attractive modality but requires use of a safe carrier that would not induce cartilage damage or fibrosis. Collagen scaffolds are widely available and could be used intra-articularly, but no investigation has looked at the safety of collagen scaffolds within synovial joints. The aim of this study was to determine the safety of collagen scaffold implantation in a validated in vivo animal model of knee arthrofibrosis. A total of 96 rabbits were randomly and equally assigned to four different groups: arthrotomy alone; arthrotomy and collagen scaffold placement; contracture surgery; and contracture surgery and collagen scaffold placement. Animals were killed in equal numbers at 72 hours, two weeks, eight weeks, and 24 weeks. Joint contracture was measured, and cartilage and synovial samples underwent histological analysis. Animals that underwent arthrotomy had equivalent joint contractures regardless of scaffold implantation (-13.9° versus -10.9°, equivalence limit 15°). Animals that underwent surgery to induce contracture did not demonstrate equivalent joint contracture s with (41.8°) or without (53.9°) collagen scaffold implantation. Chondral damage occurred in similar rates with (11 of 48) and without (nine of 48) scaffold implantation. No significant difference in synovitis was noted between groups. Absorption of the collagen scaffold occurred within eight weeks in all animals CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that intra-articular implantation of a collagen sponge does not induce synovitis or cartilage damage. Implantation in a native joint does not seem to induce contracture. Implantation of the collagen sponge in a rabbit knee model of contracture may decrease the severity of the contracture .Cite this article: J. A. Walker, T. J. Ewald, E. Lewallen, A. Van Wijnen, A. D.

      "document": "Developing understanding of object fall: Going beyond inhibitory processes A study is reported where 118 participants aged between 10 years and early 20s drew the trajectories they expected objects to follow as they fell. The younger participants typically anticipated backward trajectories during fall from moving carriers while forward but non-parabolic trajectories were relatively more frequent amongst the older participants. Both patterns suggest strong sociocultural influences, with implications for models that regard development in this area as purely the inhibition of principles established in infancy. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Research with infants demonstrates an early - established belief that dropped objects fall straight down. The erroneous expectations that pre-schoolers hold about object fall are consistent with failure to inhibit the presumption of straight - down fall, in contexts where it is inappropriate. What does this study add? The research replicates and extends research with older participants, which indicates errors that cannot be explained via failed inhibition of straight - down fall. It is the first study to trace patterns of errors across late childhood, adolescence and early adulthood. A consequence of the findings is that adequate modelling in developmental psychology must consider multilayered interactions between prior representations and sociocultural experiences.",

Their significance in noncritically ill adults remains unclear. We aimed to investigate their prevalence, electrographic characteristics, and clinical significance. We identified adult patients with B(I)RDs who received long-term EEG recordings either in the epilepsy monitoring unit or in the ambulatory setting. Patients with acute findings on imaging or status epilepticus were excluded. B(I)RDs were defined as very brief (<10 seconds) runs of focal or generalized sharply contoured rhythmic activity greater than 4 Hz, with or without evolution, that were not consistent with any known normal or benign pattern. The clinical history, EEG, and imaging results were retrieved. Each patient with B(I)RDs was matched by age and etiology to a control group with epileptiform discharges but without B(I)RDs in a 1:2 ratio. We identified B(I)RDs in 15 patients of 1,230 EEGs (1.2%). The pattern typically consisted of 0.5 to 4 second runs of sharply contoured alpha activity without evolution. All patients with B(I)RDs had epilepsy, and, when compared with controls with epilepsy but without BIRDs, were more likely to be medically refractory (10 of 15 [67%] vs. 5 of 30 [17%]; P < 0.01). All seizure onsets colocalized to the B(I)RDs, and most were morphologically similar. In noncritically ill patients, B(I)RDs are associated with refractory epilepsy and their location is correlated with the seizure onset area.",

Despite sex - specific differences in depressive symptoms prevalence at baseline (women: 17.4%, men: 8.1%), cross-sectional analyses showed no associations between sex hormones and depressive symptoms. In age-adjusted longitudinal analyses, total testosterone was associated with incident depressive symptoms (relative risk at 5- year follow-up: 0.73, 95% confidence interval: 0.58-0.92). Similarly, age-adjusted analyses showed a positive association between sex hormone-binding globulin and cognitive status in men (β-coefficient per standard deviation: 0.44, 95% confidence interval: 0.13-0.74). In women, age-adjusted associations of androstenedione with baseline depressive symptoms (relative risk: 0.88, 95% confidence interval: 0.77-0.99) were found. None of the observed associations remained after multivariable adjustment. The present population-based, longitudinal study revealed inverse associations between sex hormones and depressive symptoms. However, the null finding after multivariable adjustment suggests, that the observed associations were not independent of relevant confounders including body mass index, smoking and physical inactivity. Furthermore, the low number of incident endpoints in our non-clinical population-based sample limited the statistical power and reduced the chance to detect a statistically significant effect.",

Thus, mapping of B-cell epitopes of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) is critical to identify key immunogenic regions of HlyE. A random 20-mer peptide library was used for biopanning with enriched anti-HlyE polyclonal antibodies from typhoid patient sera. Bioinformatic tools were used to refine, analyze and map the enriched peptide sequences against the protein to identify the epitopes. The analysis identified both linear and conformational epitopes on the HlyE protein. The predicted linear GAAAGIVAG and conformational epitope PYSQESVLSADSQNQK were further validated against the pooled sera. The identified epitopes were then used to isolate epitope specific monoclonal antibodies by antibody phage display. Monoclonal scFv antibodies were enriched for both linear and conformational epitopes. Molecular docking was performed to elucidate the antigen-antibody interaction of the monoclonal antibodies against the epitopes on the HlyE monomer and oligomer structure. An in-depth view of the mechanistic and positional characteristics of the antibodies and epitope for HlyE was successfully accomplished by a combination of phage display and bioinformatic analysis.

The insect is a quarantine pest in several countries, including Argentina, the main consumer market for bananas from southern Brazil. Little information is available about the biology and ecology of this moth, such as a suitable diet for laboratory rearing. In order to provide support for integrated pest management of the pest, this study furnished data for selecting two diets suitable for continuous laboratory rearing of O. sacchari, one based on dried beans, wheat germ, soy bran, brewer's yeast, and casein and another diet with wheat germ and casein as protein sources. With both diets, the viability of the egg - adult period exceeded 68%, with fertility over 338 eggs per female. A corrected biotic potential analysis gave similar values for the two diets.",

      "document": "The regulation and adoption of health technologies under Brazil's Unified Health System: barriers to access to medicines for diseases of poverty? The study aimed to examine the regulation and adoption of health technologies for the diseases of poverty in the Brazil's Unified Health System (SUS). An exploratory, descriptive study was conducted between January and May 2016 consisting of the search and analysis of relevant documents on the websites of Brazil's National Health Surveillance Agency, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the National Commission for the Adoption of Technologies by the SUS, and Saúde Legis (the Ministry of Health's Legislation System). The 2014 version of the Brazilian National List of Essential Medicines (RENAME, acronym in Portuguese) contained 132 medicines for diseases of poverty. Over one-third of these (49) had only one national producer, while 24 were not registered in the country. The number of medicines contained in the RENAME dedicated to this group of diseases increased by 46% between 2006 and 2014. Despite advances in the regulation and incorporation of technologies by the SUS, given the lack of market interest and neglect of diseases of poverty, the government has a vital role to play in ensuring access to the best available therapies in order to reduce health inequalities. It therefore follows that Brazil needs to improve the regulation of medicines that do not attract market interest.",

Our objective is to determine the effects of human - relevant exposure levels of DOX on follicular functions across developmental time. In vitro cultured multilayered secondary mouse follicles were treated with DOX at 0, 2, 20, 100, and 200 nM for 24 h, and follicle development, hormone secretion, and oocyte maturation were analyzed. DOX caused dose-dependent toxicity on follicle growth, survival, and secretion of 17β-estradiol (E2). At 200 nM, DOX induced DNA damage and apoptosis in follicle somatic cells first and then in oocytes, which was correlated with the uptake of DOX first to the somatic cells followed by germ cells. Follicles treated with DOX at 0, 2, and 20 nM showed similar oocyte metaphase II (MII) percentages after in vitro oocyte maturation; however, 20 nM DOX significantly increased the number of MII oocytes with abnormal spindle morphology and chromosome misalignment. In an effort to harmonize the in vitro study to in vivo treatment, dose-dependent toxicity on oocyte meiotic maturation was found in 16-day-old CD-1 mice treated with DOX at 0, 0.4, 2, and 10 mg/kg, consistent with the in vitro oocyte maturation outcomes. Our study demonstrates that DOX has dose-dependent toxicity on ovarian follicle development, hormone secretion, and oocyte maturation, which are three key factors to support the female reproductive and endocrine functions.",

      "document": "Extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field exposure enhances inflammatory response and inhibits effect of antioxidant in RAW 264.7 cells In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number and variety of electronic devices that emit electromagnetic waves. Because people live and work in close proximity to these pieces of electrical equipment, there is growing concern surrounding the destruction of homeostasis by electromagnetic field exposure. In the present study, the effects of 60 Hz 0.8 mT extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMF) on a macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) were examined. Under defined ELF-EMF exposure conditions, the production of nitric oxide and pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, were increased in RAW 264.7 cells and the expression of those genes was also upregulated. However, cell proliferation was not altered. Translocation of NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa B), molecules that act downstream of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, were increased to the nucleus under ELF-EMF exposure conditions. In addition, we found that ELF-EMF exposure elevated activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) 2, as well as positively affected the influx of calcium. Furthermore, with both the presence of a potent antioxidant (Resveratrol) and downregulation of the antioxidant -related gene Prx-1 (Peroxiredoxin-1), ELF-EMF was associated with higher inflammatory responses of macrophages. These results suggest that an ELF-EMF amplifies inflammatory response s through enhanced macrophage activation and can decrease the effectiveness of antioxidants.

TRPM2 -mediated Ca(2+) signaling has been implicated in the aggravation of inflammatory diseases. Therefore, the development of TRPM2 inhibitors to prevent the aggravation of these diseases is expected. We recently reported that some Tyrphostin AG-related compounds inhibited the H2O2 - induced activation of TRPM2 by scavenging the intracellular hydroxyl radical. In the present study, we examined the effects of AG-related compounds on H2O2 - induced cellular responses in human monocytic U937 cells, which functionally express TRPM2. The effects of AG-related compounds on H2O2 - induced changes in intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, and CXCL8 secretion were assessed using U937 cells. Ca(2+) influxes via TRPM2 in response to H2O2 were blocked by AG-related compounds. AG-related compounds also inhibited the H2O2 - induced activation of ERK, and subsequent secretion of CXCL8 mediated by TRPM2 - dependent and - independent mechanisms. Our results show that AG-related compounds inhibit H2O2 - induced CXCL8 secretion following ERK activation, which is mediated by TRPM2 - dependent and - independent mechanisms in U937 cells. We previously reported that AG-related compounds blocked H2O2 - induced TRPM2 activation by scavenging the hydroxyl radical. The inhibitory effects of AG-related compounds on TRPM2 - independent responses may be due to scavenging of the hydroxyl radical.",

A MEDLINE, PsychInfo and Web of Science search was carried out to collect all publications on the frequency of MPAs and on dermatoglyphic traits in bipolar disorder and unipolar depression. 24 studies on MPAs, 19 on dermatoglyphics, and 5 dealing with both were found with discrepant findings. The relative contribution of neurodevelopmental retardation to the aetiology of affective disorders remains undetermined, the field is open for further research. Increased recognition of neurodevelopmental processes in the origin of affective disorders may allow for earlier and more effective intervention and prevention.",

In the present study, bone properties of SMP30/GNL knockout (KO) mice with deficiency in vitamin C synthesis were investigated to reveal the effects of SMP30/GNL and exogenous vitamin C supplementation on bone formation. Mineral content (BMC) and mineral density (BMD) of the mandible and femur of SMP30/GNL KO and wild-type mice at 2 and 3 months of age with or without vitamin C supplementation were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Body and bone weight of both age groups decreased and became significantly lower than those of wild-type mice. The bones of SMP30/GNL KO mice were rough and porous, with BMC and BMD significantly below wild-type. Oral supplementation with vitamin C eliminated differences in body weight, bone weight, BMC, and BMD between SMP30/GNL KO and wild-type mice at each age. These results indicate that bone degeneration in SMP30/GNL KO mice was caused by lack of vitamin C, and that this mouse strain is an appropriate model for bone metabolism in humans, which have no ability to synthesize vitamin C.",

Immunohistochemical results showed that the EtOAc extract significantly decreased the number of Iba-1-positive cells in the hippocampal region of LPS - treated mouse brains. The major effective constituent of the EtOAc extract, okanin, was further investigated. Okanin significantly suppressed LPS -induced iNOS expression and also inhibited IL-6 and TNF-α production and mRNA expression in LPS - stimulated BV-2 cells. Western blot analysis indicated that okanin suppressed LPS -induced activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway by inhibiting the phosphorylation of IκBα and decreasing the level of nuclear NF-κB p65 after LPS treatment. Immunofluorescence staining results showed that okanin inhibited the translocation of the NF-κB p65 subunit from the cytosol to the nucleus. Moreover, okanin significantly inhibited LPS -induced TLR4 expression in BV-2 cells. In summary, okanin attenuates LPS -induced activation of microglia. This effect may be associated with its capacity to inhibit the TLR4 / NF-κB signaling pathways. These results suggest that okanin may have potential as a nutritional preventive strategy for neurodegenerative disorders.",

In the search of novel therapeutic strategies for colorectal cancer, in this work we reported the photocytotoxic activity of a lipophilic zinc(II) phthalocyanine on a murine colon adenocarcinoma cell line (CT26 cells). The 2,9(10),16(17),23(24) tetrakis[(2-dimethylamino)ethylsulfanyl]phthalocyaninatozinc(II), named Pc9, was encapsulated into Tetronic® 1107 polymeric poloxamine micelles (T1107) and assayed in 2D and 3D cell cultures. We showed that the formulation Pc9 - T1107 was efficient to reduce cell viability after photodynamic treatment both in 2D cultures (IC50 10±2nM) as well as in CT26 spheroids (IC50 370±11nM). Cellular uptake of Pc9 - T1107 was a time- and concentration-dependent process, being the phthalocyanine formulation mainly incorporated into lysosomal vesicles and endoplasmic reticulum cisterns, but not in mitochondria. Pc9 - T1107 also induced the formation of reactive oxygen species immediately after cell irradiation. We also found that the phototoxic action of Pc9 - T1107 was partially reversed in the presence of antioxidants, such as TROLOX and N-acetyl-cysteine. In addition, we showed that Pc9 - T1107 treatment triggered an apoptotic cell death, as suggested by the detection of pyknotic nuclei, the reduction in the expression levels of procaspase-3 and the increase in caspase-3 enzymatic activity.",

      "document": "The use of informativity in the development of robust viromics -based examinations Metagenomics -based studies have provided insight into many of the complex microbial communities responsible for maintaining life on this planet. Sequencing efforts often uncover novel genetic content; this is most evident for phage communities, in which upwards of 90% of all sequences exhibit no similarity to any sequence in current data repositories. For the small fraction that can be identified, the top BLAST hit is generally posited as being representative of a viral taxon present in the sample of origin. Homology -based classification, however, can be misleading as sequence repositories capture but a small fraction of phage diversity. Furthermore, lateral gene transfer is pervasive within phage communities. As such, the presence of a particular gene may not be indicative of the presence of a particular viral species. Rather, it is just that: an indication of the presence of a specific gene. To circumvent this limitation, we have developed a new method for the analysis of viral metagenomic datasets. BLAST hits are weighted, integrating the sequence identity and length of alignments as well as a taxonomic signal, such that each gene is evaluated with respect to its information content. Through this quantifiable metric, predictions of viral community structure can be made with confidence. As a proof-of-concept, the approach presented here was implemented and applied to seven freshwater viral metagenomes. While providing a robust method for evaluating viral metagenomic data, the tool is versatile and can easily be customized to investigations of any environment or biome.",

      "document": "Does Intrawound Vancomycin Application During Spine Surgery Create Vancomycin-Resistant Organism? Surgical site infection (SSI) following spine surgery is a morbid and expensive complication. The use of intrawound vancomycin is emerging as a solution to reduce SSI. The development of vancomycin-resistant pathogens is an understandable concern. To determine the occurrence of vancomycin-resistant SSI in patients with and without use of intrawound vancomycin. Patients undergoing elective spine surgery were dichotomized based on whether intrawound vancomycin was applied. Outcome was occurrence of SSI requiring return to the operating room within postoperative 90 days. The intrawound culture and vancomycin minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were reviewed. Analyses were conducted to compare the pathogen profile and MIC for vancomycin in patients who received vancomycin and those who did not. Of the total 2802 patients, 43% (n = 1215) had intrawound vancomycin application during the index surgery. The use of vancomycin was associated with significantly lower deep SSI rates (1.6% [n = 20] vs 2.5% [n = 40], P = .02). The occurrence of Staphylococcus aureus SSI was significantly lower in the patients who had application of intrawound vancomycin (32% vs 65%, P = .003). None of the patients who had application of intrawound vancomycin powder, and subsequently developed an S aureus SSI, demonstrated pathogens with resistance to vancomycin. All patients had MIC < 2 μg/mL, the vancomycin susceptibility threshold. The occurrence of gram-negative SSI (28% vs 7%) and culture negative fluid collection (16% vs 5%) was higher in the vancomycin cohort. The use of intrawound vancomycin during the index spine surgery was protective against SSI following spine surgery. The application of intrawound vancomycin during index surgery does not appear to create vancomycin-resistant organisms in the event of an SSI.",

      "document": "Leptin receptor antagonism of iNKT cell function: a novel strategy to combat multiple myeloma A hallmark of bone marrow changes with aging is the increase in adipocyte composition, but how this impacts development of multiple myeloma (MM) is unknown. Here, we report the role of the adipokine leptin as master regulator of anti- myeloma tumor immunity by modulating the invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cell function. A marked increase in serum leptin levels and leptin receptor (LR) expression on iNKT cells in MM patients and the 5T33 murine MM model was observed. MM cells and leptin synergistically counteracted anti-tumor functionality of both murine and human iNKT cells. In vivo blockade of LR signalling combined with iNKT stimulation resulted in superior anti-tumor protection. This was linked to persistent IFN-γ secretion upon repeated iNKT cell stimulation and a restoration of the dynamic antigen - induced motility arrest as observed by intravital microscopy, thereby showing alleviation of iNKT cell anergy. Overall our data reveal the LR axis as novel therapeutic target for checkpoint inhibition to treat MM .Leukemia accepted article preview online, 11 May 2017. doi:10.1038/leu.2017.146.",

      "document": "Immunoassays for riboflavin and flavin mononucleotide using antibodies specific to d-ribitol and d-ribitol-5-phosphate Riboflavin (vitamin B2), a water-soluble vitamin, plays a key role in maintaining human health. Though, numerous methods have been reported for the determination of total riboflavin (TRF) content in foods and biological samples, very few methods are reported for quantifying riboflavin and its coenzymes [flavin mononucleotide (FMN); flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)] individually. Recently, we have demonstrated that antibodies specific to d-ribitol and d-ribitol-5-phosphate also recognize riboflavin and FMN, respectively, and not vice-versa. In this study, we have evaluated these two antibodies for the analysis of riboflavin and FMN by indirect competitive ELISA (icELISA) in selected foods and pharmaceuticals. Under the optimal assay conditions, 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) and limit of detection (LOD, IC10) were 3.41ng/mL and 0.02ng/mL for riboflavin, and 7.84ng/mL and 0.24ng/mL for FMN, respectively, with detectable concentration range between 0.1 and 100ng of analytes and <0.1% cross-reactivity with other water-soluble vitamins. The amounts of TRF in food samples, as analyzed by icELISA using ribitol antibody, were 90-95% of the reported values in the literature or label values. Quantification of individual flavins (riboflavin and FMN) from the same food samples showed variation in their values compared to TRF, and were in good agreement with values obtained from HPLC and AOAC methods. Further, spiking and recovery analysis of food samples and pharmaceuticals showed no significant matrix effects. The immunoassays were validated in terms of accuracy and precision using inter- and intra-assays. The immunoassays developed in this study are sensitive and appears feasible for screening a large number of samples in the quantification of riboflavin and FMN in various biological samples, pharmaceuticals and natural / processed foods.",

      "document": "Complete study demonstrating the absence of rhabdovirus in a distinct Sf9 cell line A putative novel rhabdovirus (SfRV) was previously identified in a Spodoptera frugiperda cell line (Sf9 cells [ATCC CRL-1711 lot 58078522]) by next generation sequencing and extensive bioinformatic analysis. We performed an extensive analysis of our Sf9 cell bank (ATCC CRL-1711 lot 5814 [Sf9L5814]) to determine whether this virus was already present in cells obtained from ATCC in 1987. Inverse PCR of DNA isolated from Sf9 L5814 cellular DNA revealed integration of SfRV sequences in the cellular genome. RT-PCR of total RNA showed a deletion of 320 nucleotides in the SfRV RNA that includes the transcriptional motifs for genes X and L. Concentrated cell culture supernatant was analyzed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and revealed a single band at a density of 1.14 g/ml. This fraction was further analysed by electron microscopy and showed amorphous and particulate debris that did not resemble a rhabdovirus in morphology or size. SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed that the protein composition did not contain the typical five rhabdovirus structural proteins and LC-MS/MS analysis revealed primarily of exosomal marker proteins, the SfRV N protein, and truncated forms of SfRV N, P, and G proteins. The SfRV L gene fragment RNA sequence was recovered from the supernatant after ultracentrifugation of the 1.14 g/ml fraction treated with diethyl ether suggesting that the SfRV L gene fragment sequence is not associated with a diethyl ether resistant nucleocapsid. Interestingly, the 1.14 g/ml fraction was able to transfer baculovirus DNA into Sf9L5814 cells, consistent with the presence of functional exosomes. Our results demonstrate the absence of viral particles in ATCC CRL-1711 lot 5814 Sf9 cells in contrast to a previous study that suggested the presence of infectious rhabdoviral particles in Sf9 cells from a different lot. This study highlights how cell lines with different lineages may present different virosomes and therefore no general conclusions can be drawn across Sf9 cells from different laboratories.",

Using GPS and the camera on a smartphone, the game requires players to travel in real world to capture animated creatures, called Pokémon. We examined the impact of Pokémon GO on physical activity (PA). A pre-post observational study of 167 Pokémon GO players who were self-enrolled through recruitment flyers or online social media was performed. Participants were instructed to provide screenshots of their step counts recorded by the iPhone Health app between June 15 and July 31, 2016, which was 3 weeks before and 3 weeks after the Pokémon GO release date. Of 167 participants, the median age was 25 years (interquartile range, 21-29 years). The daily average steps of participants at baseline was 5678 (SD, 2833; median, 5718 [interquartile range, 3675-7279]). After initiation of Pokémon GO, daily activity rose to 7654 steps (SD, 3616; median, 7232 [interquartile range, 5041-9744], pre-post change: 1976; 95% CI, 1494-2458, or a 34.8% relative increase [P<0.001]). On average, 10 000 \" XP\" points (a measure of game progression) was associated with 2134 additional steps per day (95% CI, 1673-2595), suggesting a potential dose-response relationship. The number of participants achieving a goal of 10 000+ steps per day increased from 15.3% before to 27.5% after (odds ratio, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.70-2.50). Increased PA was also observed in subgroups, with the largest increases seen in participants who spent more time playing Pokémon GO, those who were overweight / obese, or those with a lower baseline PA level. Pokémon GO participation was associated with a significant increase in PA among young adults. Incorporating PA into gameplay may provide an alternative way to promote PA in persons who are attracted to the game. URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT02888314.",

      "document": "Preliminary results from direct-to-facility vaccine deliveries in Kano, Nigeria As part of its vaccine supply chain redesign efforts, Kano state now pushes vaccines directly from 6 state stores to primary health centers equipped with solar refrigerators. Our objective is to describe preliminary results from the first 20 months of Kano's direct vaccine delivery operations. This is a retrospective review of Kano's direct vaccine delivery program. We analyzed trends in health facility vaccine stock levels, and examined the relationship between stock-out rates and each of cascade vaccine deliveries and timeliness of deliveries. Analysis of vaccination trends was based on administrative data from 27 sentinel health facilities. Costs for both the in-sourced and out-sourced approaches were estimated using a bottoms-up model-based approach. Overall stock adequacy increased from 54% in the first delivery cycle to 68% by cycle 33. Conversely, stock-out rates decreased from 41% to 10% over the same period. Similar trends were observed in the out-sourced and in-sourced programs. Stock-out rates rose incrementally with increasing number of cascade facilities, and delays in vaccine deliveries correlated strongly with stock-out rates. Recognizing that stock availability is one of many factors contributing to vaccinations, we nonetheless compared pre - and post - direct deliveries vaccinations in sentinel facilities, and found statistically significant upward trends for 4 out of 6 antigens. 1 antigen (measles) showed an upward trend that was not statistically significant. Hepatitis b vaccinations declined during the period. Overall, there appeared to be a one- year lag between commencement of direct deliveries and the increase in number of vaccinations. Weighted average cost per delivery is US$29.8 and cost per child immunized is US$0.7 per year. Direct vaccine delivery to health facilities in Kano, through a streamlined architecture, has resulted in decreased stock-outs and improved stock adequacy. Concurrent operation of insourced and outsourced programs has enabled Kano build in-house logistics capabilities.",

All the derivatives were evaluated for cytotoxic activity by MTT assay against five different human cancer cell lines: lung (A549), colon (HCT116), prostate (PC3), pancreatic (MIA PaCa-2) and breast (T47D). The data revealed that compounds 11c, 11d, 11g, 11h and 13a possess most promising cytotoxic potential. The compound 11h was one of the most active compounds, with IC50 values in the range of 4-6µM against all the five cancer cell lines. The results of this study suggested that derivatives with free -OH (11c, 11d and 11g) and free -COOH (11h and 13a) substitutions in the triazole moiety introduced at the C-28 position significantly improved the anti-tumor activity and may be the favourable position to synthesize potent anticancer leads from BA. Introduction of a non polar alkyl groups at C-28 position (10, 12 and 14) resulted in the significant loss of the activity. Further, DAPI staining, ROS generation and wound healing experiments revealed that compound 11h induces apoptosis in HCT-116 cells.",

      "document": "A comparison of DALYs for periodontal disease in China between 1990 and 2013: insights from the 2013 global burden of disease study China has undergone a rapid demographic and epidemiological transition with fast ecomonic development since the 1980s. Oral health is becoming a major public health problem as the prevalence of non-communicable diseases has greatly increased. Periodontal disease (PD) and caries are among the most prevalent oral diseases. PD accounts for the majority of tooth loss and increases with age. China's third national epidemiological investigation on oral diseases (2005) revealed that periodontitis affected >50% of the adult population. The Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013) have been used to estimate DALYs for 301 acute and chronic diseases and injuries in 188 countries for 1990-2013. The estimation of burden of PD between 1990 and 2013 will provide a unique perspective for planning interventions and developing public health policies for PD even chronic diseases in China. We used the GBD 2013 results for Years of Life Lost (YLLs) and Years Lived with Disability (YLDs) to calculate Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) for PD in China. PD standardized DALYs rate (SDR) per 100,000 persons, the percentage of PD standardized DALYs rate (% PD SDR) in all diseases DALYs, and variance ratio of these two indexes between the years of 1990 and 2013 were compared by province, gender and age groups. Nationwide, compared to 1990, the SDR in 2013 increased slightly from 24.7 to 25.7, while the variance ratio of SDR for provinces in the middle, west and south of China showed a greater variation(4.8-6.2%). The % PD SDR in all disease DALYs increased from 0.06 to 0.11% for all groups. The four highest variance ratios % PD SDR in all diseases DALYs between 1990 and 2013 occurred in the west of China (97, 98.6, 108.4 and 112.8%). The PD SDR changed slightly in the women (20.3 to 21.7), meanwhile the variance ratio of PD SDR and % PD SDR in all diseases DALYs for the women (6.7 and 94.5%) was also higher than for men (2.1 and 60.6%). The highest variance ratio % PD SDR in all oral diseases DALYs occurred between 1990 and 2013 in ages 20 to 24 (50.7%) and 25 to 29 years (50.5%). The PD standardized DALYs rate and % PD SDR in all diseases DALYs in China in 2013 has increased from 1990. Especially, the variance ratio of % PD SDR in all disease DALYs among Young population and women, in the west provinces of China have been becoming the highest in all age groups and national wide. Future intervention measurements should include young women of child-bearing age because women's health impacts infant health. Periodontal disease has risk factors in common with a number of other non-communicable diseases (NCD) and conditions, and focusing on the common behavioral and environmental risk factors would be instrumental in the effective prevention of periodontal disease.",

Halophytes occur naturally in high - salt environments, and their roots may be associated with promising microbial candidates for promoting growth and salt tolerance in crops. This study aimed to isolate efficient halotolerant plant - growth - promoting rhizobacterial strains from halophytes and evaluate their activity and effects on sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L .) growth under salinity stress. A total of 23 isolates were initially screened for their ability to secrete 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (ACD) as well as other plant-growth - promoting characteristics and subsequently identified by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. Three isolates, identified as Micrococcus yunnanensis, Planococcus rifietoensis and Variovorax paradoxus, enhanced salt stress tolerance remarkably in sugar beet, resulting in greater seed germination and plant biomass, higher photosynthetic capacity and lower stress - induced ethylene production at different NaCl concentrations (50-125 mM). These results demonstrate that salinity - adapted, ACD -producing bacteria isolated from halophytes could promote sugar beet growth under saline stress conditions.",

To determine pain control and side effects after gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for classical idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (TN) with or without neurovascular compression (NVC). This study included 47 patients with type 1 idiopathic TN and Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) pain class IV or V that were treated with GKRS, with maximal dose of 85 Gy targeting root entry zone, as a first-treatment modality between January 2005 and March 2015. A retrospective analysis was made of NVC status, pain control, side effects, recurrence, and cross-sectional area. During the median 21.5 months follow-up (range, 3-119 months), 36 (76.6%) patients showed good outcomes (improved to below BNI class IIIa). Twenty two patients did not show NVC (group A) and 25 had NVC present (group B). Good outcomes were not different in two groups (group A: 19/22; group B: 17/25)(p = 0.138). The numbers of cases in BNI class I or II, and recurrences were not different (p = 0.532, 0.786, respectively). The mean areas were 8.64 ± 2.59 mm3 in non-deviated cases (n = 27) and 2.59 ± 1.68 mm3 in deviated (n = 10). Side effects were significantly more frequent in deviated cases (8/10; 80%) than in non-deviated (7/27; 25.9%) (p = 0.003). NVC is not a predictive factor for pain control after GKRS for the treatment of idiopathic TN. Side effects may occur more frequently in patients with NVC at the target coordinate when a root entry zone is used, but the subjective symptoms are not always bothersome.",

However, little is known about the physical activity patterns of bladder cancer survivors and how these are related to HRQOL in the United States. Our objective was to describe self-reported physical activity patterns and HRQOL and examine the association between these measures in a large cohort of bladder cancer survivors. In this cross-sectional study, long-term bladder cancer survivors identified through an institutional database were mailed a survey that included the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Bladder Cancer (FACT-BL) and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Associations between HRQOL, as assessed by the FACT-BL, and physical activity, as assessed by the IPAQ, were examined by stratified analyses of HRQOL by different levels of physical activity, proportional odds ordinal logistic regression models, and local polynomial regression models. A total of 472 subjects (49% response rate) completed the survey. The mean age was 74 years; 81% were male and 87% were white. The median total weekly physical activity was 2,794 MET-min. Subjects reporting \" high \" physical activity had a median FACT-BL score of 129 compared with 119 among those reporting \" low \" physical activity, a statistically and clinically significant difference. Similarly, subjects reporting \" high \" physical activity had a 2.2-fold increased odds of reporting higher global HRQOL compared with subjects reporting \" low \" physical activity. This large cohort of bladder cancer survivors reported high levels of physical activity. Physical activity was positively associated with HRQOL. Further studies investigating the causal relationship between physical activity and HRQOL in the posttreatment setting in bladder cancer survivors are warranted.",

In this secondary analysis, we investigated whether the presence of CM results in a differential indication for the Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP) or escitalopram plus clinical management (ESC). Sixty patients with chronic depression were randomized to either 22 sessions of CBASP or ESC over the course of 8 weeks of acute and 20 weeks of extended treatment at 2 German treatment sites. CM was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and the clinician rated Early Trauma Inventory. Intention-to-treat analyses were used to examine the impact of CM on depression, global functioning, and quality of life. The presence of CM did not result in significant differences in treatment response to CBASP or ESC on any outcome measure after 28 weeks of treatment independent of the type of CM assessment. After 8 weeks, a significant CM × treatment interaction was found for scores on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Patients with a history of CM receiving CBASP had a significantly lower response rate compared to patients without CM and to those receiving ESC after 8 weeks. Conclusively, CBASP and ESC are equally effective treatment options for the difficult to treat subgroup of patients with chronic depression and a history of CM. CM may be a predictor of a longer latency of treatment response in the case of psychotherapy. CBASP and escitalopram are equally effective treatment options for chronic depression. Both treatments are also equally effective for the difficult to treat subgroup of patients with chronic depression and a history of childhood maltreatment. Childhood maltreatment may result in a longer latency of treatment response in the case of psychotherapy.",

      "document": "Pig has no uncoupling protein 1 Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is critical for mammal's survival in the cold environment. Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is responsible for the non-shivering thermogenesis in the BAT. Pig is important economically as a meat -producing livestock. However, whether BAT or more precisely UCP1 protein exists in pig remains a controversy. The objective of this study was to ascertain whether pig has UCP1 protein. In this study, we used rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique to obtain the UCP1 mRNA 3' end sequence, confirmed only exons 1 and 2 of the UCP1 gene are transcribed in the pig. Then we cloned the pig UCP1 gene exons 1 and 2, and expressed the UCP1 protein from the truncated pig gene using E. coli BL21. We used the expressed pig UCP1 protein as antigen for antibody production in a rabbit. We could not detect any UCP1 protein expression in different pig adipose tissues by the specific pig UCP1 antibody, while our antibody can detect the cloned pig UCP1 as well as the mice adipose UCP1 protein. This result shows although exons 1 and 2 of the pig UCP1 gene were transcribed but not translated in the pig adipose tissue. Furthermore, we detected no uncoupled respiration in the isolated pig adipocytes. Thus, these results unequivocally demonstrate that pig has no UCP1 protein. Our results have resolved the controversy of whether pigs have the brown adipose tissue.",

      "document": "Quantitative assessment of passive electrical properties of the cardiac T-tubular system by FRAP microscopy Well-coordinated activation of all cardiomyocytes must occur on every heartbeat. At the cell level, a complex network of sarcolemmal invaginations, called the transverse-axial tubular system (TATS), propagates membrane potential changes to the cell core, ensuring synchronous and uniform excitation-contraction coupling. Although myocardial conduction of excitation has been widely described, the electrical properties of the TATS remain mostly unknown. Here, we exploit the formal analogy between diffusion and electrical conductivity to link the latter with the diffusional properties of TATS. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) microscopy is used to probe the diffusion properties of TATS in isolated rat cardiomyocytes: A fluorescent dextran inside TATS lumen is photobleached, and signal recovery by diffusion of unbleached dextran from the extracellular space is monitored. We designed a mathematical model to correlate the time constant of fluorescence recovery with the apparent diffusion coefficient of the fluorescent molecules. Then, apparent diffusion is linked to electrical conductivity and used to evaluate the efficiency of the passive spread of membrane depolarization along TATS. The method is first validated in cells where most TATS elements are acutely detached by osmotic shock and then applied to probe TATS electrical conductivity in failing heart cells. We find that acute and pathological tubular remodeling significantly affect TATS electrical conductivity. This may explain the occurrence of defects in action potential propagation at the level of single T-tubules, recently observed in diseased cardiomyocytes.",

Immunohistochemical results showed that the EtOAc extract significantly decreased the number of Iba-1-positive cells in the hippocampal region of LPS - treated mouse brains. The major effective constituent of the EtOAc extract, okanin, was further investigated. Okanin significantly suppressed LPS -induced iNOS expression and also inhibited IL-6 and TNF-α production and mRNA expression in LPS - stimulated BV-2 cells. Western blot analysis indicated that okanin suppressed LPS -induced activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway by inhibiting the phosphorylation of IκBα and decreasing the level of nuclear NF-κB p65 after LPS treatment. Immunofluorescence staining results showed that okanin inhibited the translocation of the NF-κB p65 subunit from the cytosol to the nucleus. Moreover, okanin significantly inhibited LPS -induced TLR4 expression in BV-2 cells. In summary, okanin attenuates LPS -induced activation of microglia. This effect may be associated with its capacity to inhibit the TLR4 / NF-κB signaling pathways. These results suggest that okanin may have potential as a nutritional preventive strategy for neurodegenerative disorders.",

Each patient received lung transplantation at an average age of 11 months (range, 5-15 months).

      "document": "Capsular Polysaccharide Types and Virulence-Related Traits of Epidemic KPC - Producing Klebsiella pneumoniae Isolates in a Chinese University Hospital Klebsiella pneumoniae is an important human pathogen associated with a variety of diseases and the prevalence of blaKPC carrying K. pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) is rapidly increasing. Capsule is an important virulence factor in K. pneumoniae. In this study, we determined to first systematically characterize capsular polysaccharide (CPS) and virulence traits in KPC-Kp strains. A total of 56 KPC-Kp isolates were recovered from clinical samples in a Chinese hospital, which were assigned to clonal lineages by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Capsule typing (wzi sequencing and wzc polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) and virulence genes were characterized by molecular approaches. The virulence of these strains was determined by biofilm formation, serum killing resistance, phagocytosis, and infection models. Six different STs were found among 56 KPC-Kp isolates: 76.8% (43 of 56 isolates) belonged to ST11, 6 isolates belonged to ST147, 4 isolates belonged to ST15, 1 isolate belonged to ST1456, 1 isolate belonged to ST65, and 1 isolate was ST23. Based on the wzi gene DNA sequences and wzc PCR, these 56 strains were classified as capsular type wzi47-K47 (n = 37), wzi64-K64 (n = 8), wzi8-K8 (n = 4), wzi37-K37 (n = 4), wzi53-K53 (n = 1), wzi125-K2 (n = 1), and wzi1-K1 (n = 1). Heterogeneity was detected in biofilm formation and phagocytosis among different CPS types. ST11 strains were less virulent than other ST strains. KPC-Kp strains exhibit variability of virulence-associated traits. Differences were associated with the ST types and CPS.",

DCs loaded with MUC1-derived peptide were subcutaneously administered to patients with MUC1-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that was refractory to standard anticancer therapies, every 2 weeks. The effectiveness and tolerability of the vaccine were evaluated, and predictive biomarkers of clinical responses were explored. Between August 2005 and May 2015, 40 patients received the vaccines. The median survival time (MST) after the initial vaccination was 7.4 months, and the 1-year survival rate was 25.0%. The MST for patients who received more than six vaccinations was 9.5 months, and the 1-year survival rate was 39.3%. In this cohort, patients who experienced immune-related adverse events, including skin reactions at the vaccination site and fever, had significantly longer survival times compared with patients without those immune-related adverse events (12.6 versus 6.7 months, p = 0.042). Longer survival times were also observed in patients whose peripheral white blood cells contained >20.0% lymphocytes (12.6 versus 4.5 months; p = 0.014). MUC1 -specific cytotoxic immune responses were achieved in all of seven patients analyzed who received six vaccinations. The MUC1 -targeted DC -based vaccine induced an antitumor immune response that promoted prolonged survival of patients with refractory NSCLC.

The cytotoxic, antiproliferative and antimigratory effects of CF leaf extract on human liver cancer HepG2 cell lines were evaluated using sulforhodamine B, colony formation, and wound healing assays. In addition, apoptosis induction mechanisms were investigated via reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, caspase 3 activities, and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) disruption. Gene expression and apoptosis -associated protein levels were measured by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. CF induced HepG2 cell death in a time- and dose-dependent manner with half maximal inhibitory concentration values of 219.03±9.96 and 124.90±6.86 µg/ml at 24 and 48 h, respectively. Treatment with CF caused a significant and dose-dependent decrease in colony forming ability and cell migration. Furthermore, the present study demonstrated that CF induced ROS formation, increased caspase 3 activities, decreased the ΔΨm, and caused HepG2 apoptosis. CF marginally decreased the expression level of the cell cycle regulatory protein, ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (rho family, small GTP binding protein Rac1) and the downstream protein, cyclin dependent kinase 6. Additionally, CF significantly enhanced p21 levels, reduced cyclin D1 protein levels and triggered cancer cell death. CF leaf extracts induced cell death, stimulated apoptosis and inhibited migration in HepG2 cells. Thus, CF may be useful for developing an anticancer drug candidate for the treatment of liver cancer.",

      "document": "Budd-Chiari syndrome secondary to catheter -associated inferior vena cava thrombosis Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk for thrombotic complications. The use of central venous catheters as dialysis vascular access additionally increases this risk. We describe the first case of Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) secondary to central venous catheter misplacement in a patient with CKD. A 30-year-old female patient with HIV/AIDS and CKD on hemodialysis was admitted to the emergency room for complaints of fever, prostration, and headache in the last six days. She had a tunneled dialysis catheter placed at the left jugular vein. The diagnosis of BCS was established by abdominal computed tomography that showed a partial thrombus within the inferior vena cava which extended from the right atrium to medium hepatic vein, and continuing along the left hepatic vein. Patient was treated with anticoagulants and discharged asymptomatic. Budd-Chiari syndrome is a rare medical condition caused by hepatic veins thrombosis. It can involve one, two, or all three of the major hepatic veins. It is usually related to myeloproliferative disorders, malignancy and hypercoagulable states. This case calls attention for inadvertent catheter tip placement into hepatic vein leading to this rare complication. Assessment of catheter dialysis tip location with radiological image seems to be a prudent measure after each procedure even if the tunneled dialysis catheter has been introduced with fluoroscopy image.",

Maximizing the geographic separation of right and left ventricular pacing lead sites has been suggested as one way to improve response. Cardiac CT provides an opportunity to explore 3-dimensional inter-lead distance (ILD) measures for the prediction of CRT response. The objective of this study was to investigate associations between standardized measures of ILD by cardiac CT and echocardiographic response to CRT. Forty-two consecutive patients undergoing CRT had serial clinical and echocardiographic evaluations performed in addition to a post-procedural cardiac -gated CT with blinded measurement of direct and circumferential (via the myocardium) ILD measures. Clinical response to CRT, the primary clinical outcome, was defined as a ≥15% reduction in LVESV using echocardiography at 6-months. The mean age and ejection fraction was 63.6 ± 8.9 years and 25.2 ± 7.8%, respectively. The primary outcome occurred in 35 of 42 patients (83%). Both direct and circumferential CT -based ILD measures were associated with the primary outcome by univariate analysis. Receiver Operator Characteristic analysis identified Circumferential ILD to have the strongest predictive accuracy (AUC 0.78). Inter- and intra-observer reproducibility of CT -derived ILD measures was excellent. Circumferential ILD measures on cardiac CT are predictive of clinical response to CRT. Incorporation of these measures into the selection of optimal pacing targets, particularly from pre-procedural CT coronary vein imaging may be of therapeutic benefit and warrants further investigation.",

Water behavior beneath the peptide adsorbed to a hydrophilic surface was observed to vary with the height of the peptide above the surface. In general, the orientation of water close to the peptide (with the oxygen atom pointing up toward the peptide) was complementary to that observed near the hydrophilic surface in the absence of peptide. That is, no change in orientation of water trapped between the peptide and a hydrophilic surface is required as the peptide approaches the surface. The adsorption of the peptide to the hydrophilic surface was observed to be mediated by a layer of ordered water. Water was found to be largely excluded on adsorption to the hydrophobic surface. However, the small amount of water present was observed to be highly ordered. At the closest point of contact to the hydrophobic surface, the peptide was observed to make direct contact. These findings shed light on the fundamental driving forces of peptide adsorption to hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces in aqueous environments.",

Evidence of good internal consistency and also convergent and divergent validity was obtained for both samples.

      "document": "Quantitative analysis of cell proliferation by a dye dilution assay: Application to cell lines and cocultures Cell proliferation represents one of the most fundamental processes in biological systems, thus the quantitative analysis of cell proliferation is important in many biological applications such as drug screening, production of biologics, and assessment of cytotoxicity. Conventional proliferation assays mainly quantify cell number based on a calibration curve of a homogeneous cell population, and therefore are not applicable for the analysis of cocultured cells. Moreover, these assays measure cell proliferation indirectly, based on cellular metabolic activity or DNA content. To overcome these shortcomings, a dye dilution assay employing fluorescent cell tracking dyes that are retained within cells was applied and was diluted proportionally by subsequent cell divisions. Here, it was demonstrated that this assay could be implemented to quantitatively analyze the cell proliferation of different types of cell lines, and to concurrently analyze the proliferation of two types of cell lines in coculture by utilizing cell tracking dyes with different spectral characteristics. The mean division time estimated by the dye dilution assay is compared with the population doubling time obtained from conventional methods and values from literature. Additionally, dye transfer between cocultured cells was investigated and it was found that it is a characteristic of the cells rather than a characteristic of the dye. It was suggested that this method can be easily combined with other flow cytometric analyses of cellular properties, providing valuable information on cell status under diverse conditions. © 2017 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.",

      "document": "A novel assay to measure tertiary and quaternary amines in wastewater: An indicator for NDMA wastewater precursors This study examined the potential of using a novel bulk amine assay as an approximation for the tertiary and quaternary amine load in wastewaters and surface water samples, and this approximation was compared to N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation potential using chloramines. An existing colorimetric method was examined and optimized for the detection of amines in environmental water samples. The method consists of liquid-liquid extraction followed by a catalyzed reaction to form a yet- undefined product that is known to be both a strong chromophore and fluorophore. Previous work verified that this reaction was effectively catalyzed by a number of compounds containing tertiary and quaternary amine moieties. Many tertiary and quaternary compounds are also efficient producers of NDMA under chloramination conditions, and a linear correlation was consequently derived from the bulk amine signals vs. NDMA formation potential in various wastewater samples (R(2) = 0.74; n = 24; p-value < 0.05). The results provide evidence that approximately 2% of the tertiary and quaternary amines measured can form NDMA and an estimated 0.01-1.3% of nitrogen in dissolved organic nitrogen originates from these bulk amines. The normalization of NDMA concentration by the amine measurement revealed that ozone effectively destroyed those tertiary and quaternary amine structures more likely to form NDMA in treated wastewater samples. This bulk amine assay illustrates that proxy measurements of tertiary and quaternary amines can be linked to the NDMA formation potential of a given sample, and this approach may prove useful as a characterizing tool for NDMA precursors in wastewater.",

      "document": "Role of Intestinal LXRα in Regulating Post-prandial Lipid Excursion and Diet - Induced Hypercholesterolemia and Hepatic Lipid Accumulation Post-prandial hyperlipidemia has emerged as a cardiovascular risk factor with limited therapeutic options. The Liver X receptors (Lxrs) are nuclear hormone receptors that regulate cholesterol elimination. Knowledge of their role in regulating the absorption and handling of dietary fats is incomplete. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of intestinal Lxrα in post-prandial intestinal lipid transport. Using Lxrα knockout (nr1h3(-/-)) and intestine - limited Lxrα over-expressing [Tg(fabp2a: EGFP - nr1h3)] zebrafish strains, we measured post-prandial lipid excursion with live imaging in larvae and physiological methods in adults. We also conducted a long-term high - cholesterol dietary challenge in adults to examine the chronic effect of modulating nr1h3 gene dose on the development of hypercholesterolemia and hepatic lipid accumulation. Over-expression of Lxrα in the intestine delays the transport of ingested lipids in larvae, while deletion of Lxrα increases the rate of lipid transport. Pre-treating wildtype larvae with the liver-sparing Lxr agonist hyodeoxycholic acid also delayed the rate of intestinal lipid transport in larvae. In adult males, deletion of Lxrα accelerates intestinal transport of ingested lipids. Adult females showed higher plasma Lipoprotein lipase (Lpl) activity compared to males, and lower post-gavage blood triacylglycerol (TAG) excursion. Despite the sexually dimorphic effect on acute intestinal lipid handling, Tg(fabp2a: EGFP - nr1h3) adults of both sexes are protected from high cholesterol diet (HCD)- induced hepatic lipid accumulation, while nr1h3(-/-) mutants are sensitive to the effects of HCD challenge. These data indicate that intestinal Lxr activity dampens the pace of intestinal lipid transport cell-autonomously. Selective activation of intestinal Lxrα holds therapeutic promise.",

      "document": "Young people, mental health practitioners and researchers co-produce a Transition Preparation Programme to improve outcomes and experience for young people leaving Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) In the UK young people attending child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) are required to move on, either through discharge or referral to an adult service, at age 17/18, a period of increased risk for onset of mental health problems and other complex psychosocial and physical changes. CAMHS transitions are often poorly managed with negative outcomes for young people. Better preparation may improve outcomes and experience. This study aimed to co-produce, with young people who had transitioned or were facing transition from CAMHS, a CAMHS Transition Preparation Programme (TPP), deliverable in routine NHS settings. Eighteen young people, aged 17-22, from three UK National Health Service (NHS) mental health foundation trusts participated in creative, participatory research workshops. Seven parents completed short questionnaires. Thirty clinical staff from two trusts took part in workshops to ensure deliverability of young people's ideas. Young people were offered co-research opportunities. Most young people felt anxious, fearful and uncertain on leaving CAMHS and perceived mental health services as uncaring. Participants outlined transition procedures and drafted a range of preparation activities, centred around dedicated Transition Peer Support and a transition booklet, which should be offered to all CAMHS leavers, irrespective of discharge or transfer to an adult service. Preparation should aim to build confidence to help young people take responsibility for themselves and flourish in the adult world: coping or getting through it was not enough. Some clinicians also felt anxious at transition and recognised the potential impact on young people of poor communication and lack of understanding between services. Parents would appreciate help to support their offspring during the transition period. Clinicians cited lack of funding and inflexible NHS procedures and policies as potential barriers to the implementation of young people's ideas. Nine young people took up co-research opportunities. Mental health services underestimate the anxiety of CAMHS leavers. Young people have clear ideas about the preparation they require to leave CAMHS with the confidence to take responsibility for their own health care. Close collaboration of NHS staff and researchers facilitates the implementation of research findings.",

We evaluated the outcome of elderly patients who benefited from ICOAS for a strictly palliative goal METHODS: We performed a national retrospective cohort study in France of patients aged >75years old with PJI, and managed with ICOAS planned for life long from 2009 to 2014, and compared the population with an event versus the population free of event. Event was defined as a composite outcome in patients under ICOAS, including: local or systemic progression of the infection; death or discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy because of adverse drug reaction. Twenty-one patients were included, with a median age of 85 (IQR: 81; 88) years old. There were 8/21 patients with an event: 1 patient with adverse drug reaction; 3 patients had systemic progression of sepsis; and 2 had local progression. A total of 2/21 patients died. No deaths were related to ICOAS or infection. There was no significant difference (p >0.05) between the population with an event and free of event considering demographic, clinical and microbiological characteristics. In our cohort, ICOAS seems to be an effective and safe option.",

A systematic review (SR) was performed by 2 independent reviewers using 3 electronic databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus). The database search employed the following key words: \" topical fluorides \" AND \" children \" AND \" clinical trials \"; \" topical fluorides \" OR \" silver diamine fluoride \" AND \" randomized controlled trial \"; \" silver diamine fluoride \" AND \" children \" OR \" primary dentition \" AND \" tooth decay \"; \" silver diamine fluoride \" OR \" sodium fluoride varnish \" AND \" early childhood caries \"; and \" silver diamine fluoride \" AND \" children \". Inclusion criteria were articles published in English, from 2005 to January 2016, on clinical studies using SDF as a treatment intervention to evaluate caries arrest in children with primary dentition and/or permanent first molars. Database searches provided 821 eligible publications, of which 33 met the inclusion criteria. After the abstracts were prescreened, 25 articles were dismissed based on exclusion criteria. The remaining 8 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 7 publications were included in the SR. These included 1 study assessing the effectiveness of SDF at different concentrations; 3 studies comparing SDF with other interventions; 2 investigations comparing SDF at different application frequencies and with other interventions; and 1 study comparing semiannual SDF applications versus a control group. The literature indicates that SDF is a preventive treatment for dental caries in community settings. At concentrations of 30% and 38%, SDF shows potential as an alternative treatment for caries arrest in the primary dentition and permanent first molars. To establish guidelines, more studies are needed to fully assess the effectiveness of SDF and to determine the appropriate application frequency.",

The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of mask ventilation between two commonly used techniques of two-handed mask ventilation in obese unconscious apnoeic adults. Eighty-one obese adults received mask ventilation after induction using C-E clamp and modified V-E clamp techniques in a randomized crossover manner. Mechanical ventilation was provided using a pressure-control mode, at a rate of 10 bpm, with an inspiratory-to-expiratory time ratio of 1:2 and a pre-set plateau airway pressure of 20 cm H 2 O. The primary outcome was expired tidal volume. The BMI for the subjects was 37 (sd 4.9) kg m -2. The failure rates for mask ventilation (tidal volume ≤ anatomical dead space) were 44% for the C-E technique and 0% for the V-E technique (P <0.001). Tidal volume was significantly lower for the C-E than the V-E technique [371 (sd 345) vs 720 (244) ml, P <0.001]. The peak airway pressures were 21 (sd 1.5) cm H 2 O for the C-E technique and 21 (1.3) cm H 2 O for the V-E technique. Mask ventilation using the modified V-E technique is more effective than with the C-E technique in unconscious obese apnoeic adults. Subjects who fail ventilation with the C-E technique can be ventilated effectively with the V-E technique. NCT02580526.",

To determine pain control and side effects after gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for classical idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (TN) with or without neurovascular compression (NVC). This study included 47 patients with type 1 idiopathic TN and Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) pain class IV or V that were treated with GKRS, with maximal dose of 85 Gy targeting root entry zone, as a first-treatment modality between January 2005 and March 2015. A retrospective analysis was made of NVC status, pain control, side effects, recurrence, and cross-sectional area. During the median 21.5 months follow-up (range, 3-119 months), 36 (76.6%) patients showed good outcomes (improved to below BNI class IIIa). Twenty two patients did not show NVC (group A) and 25 had NVC present (group B). Good outcomes were not different in two groups (group A: 19/22; group B: 17/25)(p = 0.138). The numbers of cases in BNI class I or II, and recurrences were not different (p = 0.532, 0.786, respectively). The mean areas were 8.64 ± 2.59 mm3 in non-deviated cases (n = 27) and 2.59 ± 1.68 mm3 in deviated (n = 10). Side effects were significantly more frequent in deviated cases (8/10; 80%) than in non-deviated (7/27; 25.9%) (p = 0.003). NVC is not a predictive factor for pain control after GKRS for the treatment of idiopathic TN. Side effects may occur more frequently in patients with NVC at the target coordinate when a root entry zone is used, but the subjective symptoms are not always bothersome.",

However, it is unknown whether guidelines, policies, regulations, or laws exist to guide pre-hospital ACS care in India. We undertook a nation-wide document analysis to address this gap in knowledge. From November 2014 to May 2016, we searched for publicly available emergency care guidelines and legislation addressing pre-hospital ACS care in all 29 Indian states and 7 Union Territories via Internet search and direct correspondence. We found two documents addressing pre-hospital ACS care. Though India has legislation mandating acute care for emergencies such as trauma, regulations or laws to guide pre-hospital ACS care are largely absent.

This property is clinically relevant for the improvement of T cell -based antitumor therapies. Diacylglycerol kinase α and ζ (DGKα / ζ) metabolize the diacylglycerol generated following antigen recognition by T lymphocytes. Enhanced expression of these two lipid kinases in tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells promotes a hyporesponsive state that contributes to tumor immune escape. Inhibition of these two enzymes might thus be of interest for potentiating conventional antigen -directed tumor elimination. In this study, we sought to characterize the contribution of DGKα and ζ to antigen -independent cytotoxic functions of CD8(+) T cells. Analysis of DGKζ - deficient mice showed an increase in bystander memory -like CD8(+) T cell populations not observed in DGKα - deficient mice. We demonstrate that DGKζ limits cytokine responses in an antigen -independent manner. Cytokine -specific expansion of DGKζ - deficient CD8(+) T cells promoted enhanced differentiation of innate-like cytotoxic cells in vitro, and correlated with the more potent in vivo anti-tumor responses of DGKζ - deficient mice engrafted with the murine A20 lymphoma. Our studies reveal a isoform - specific function for DGKζ downstream of IL-2 / IL-15 -mediated expansion of innate-like cytotoxic T cells, Pharmacological manipulation of DGKζ activity is of therapeutic interest for cytokine -directed anti-tumor treatments.",

Halophytes occur naturally in high - salt environments, and their roots may be associated with promising microbial candidates for promoting growth and salt tolerance in crops. This study aimed to isolate efficient halotolerant plant - growth - promoting rhizobacterial strains from halophytes and evaluate their activity and effects on sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L .) growth under salinity stress. A total of 23 isolates were initially screened for their ability to secrete 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (ACD) as well as other plant-growth - promoting characteristics and subsequently identified by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. Three isolates, identified as Micrococcus yunnanensis, Planococcus rifietoensis and Variovorax paradoxus, enhanced salt stress tolerance remarkably in sugar beet, resulting in greater seed germination and plant biomass, higher photosynthetic capacity and lower stress - induced ethylene production at different NaCl concentrations (50-125 mM). These results demonstrate that salinity - adapted, ACD -producing bacteria isolated from halophytes could promote sugar beet growth under saline stress conditions.",

Here we describe GECCO (Genomic Enrichment Computational Clustering Operation) to analyze somatic noncoding alterations in 308 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAs) and identify commonly mutated regulatory regions. We find recurrent noncoding mutations to be enriched in PDA pathways, including axon guidance and cell adhesion, and newly identified processes, including transcription and homeobox genes. We identified mutations in protein binding sites correlating with differential expression of proximal genes and experimentally validated effects of mutations on expression. We developed an expression modulation score that quantifies the strength of gene regulation imposed by each class of regulatory elements, and found the strongest elements were most frequently mutated, suggesting a selective advantage. Our detailed single-cancer analysis of noncoding alterations identifies regulatory mutations as candidates for diagnostic and prognostic markers, and suggests new mechanisms for tumor evolution.",

A German translation of the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) from the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) consortium was used in the LIBRE study, investigating effects of lifestyle - intervention on women with BRCA1 / 2 mutations. The purpose of the present study is to validate the MEDAS German version. LIBRE is a multicentre (three university hospitals during this pilot phase), unblinded, randomized, controlled clinical trial. Women with a BRCA1 / 2 mutation of age 18 or over who provided written consent were eligible for the trial. As part of the assessment, all were given a full-length Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) and MEDAS at baseline and after 3 months. Data derived from FFQ was compared to MEDAS in order to evaluate agreement or concordance between the two questionnaires. Additionally, the association of dietary intake biomarkers in the blood (β-carotene, omega-3, omega-6 and omega-9 fatty acids and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP)) with some MEDAS items was analyzed using t-Tests and a multivariate regression. The participants of the LIBRE pilot study were 68 in total (33 Intervention, 35 Control). Only participants who completed both questionnaires were included in this analysis (baseline: 66, month three: 54). The concordance between these two questionnaires varied between the items (Intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.91 for pulses at the highest and -0.33 for sugar-sweetened drinks). Mean MEDAS scores (sum of all items) were 9% higher than their FFQ counter-parts at baseline and 15% after 3 months. Higher fish consumption (at least 3 portions) was associated with lower omega-6 fatty acid levels (p = 0.026) and higher omega-3 fatty acid levels (p = 0.037), both results being statistically significant. We conclude that the German MEDAS in its current version could be a useful tool in clinical trials and in practice to assess adherence to MD.

In Turkey A. agallocha is one of the ingredients while preparing famous Mesir paste, which was invented as a medicinal paste and used from the Ottoman period to now at least for 500 years. The identification the in vitro antimicrobial activity of ethanol extract of A. agallocha roots is main purpose of this analysis. By using 17 bacteria and 1 fungi, which include Bacillus, Candida, Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Escherichia, Klebsiella, Listeria, Pseudomonas, Salmonella and Staphylococcus genera, the activity of A. agallocha root extracts were analysed by the help of the disk diffusion method, that is one of the methods commonly used to determine antimicrobial activities. As a result of the study it was observed that ethanol extracts of A. agallocha roots have a clear antimicrobial activity against nearly all microorganism used in the study, but only two bacteria namely E. coli ATCC 25922 and S. typhimurium SL 1344. According to the disk diffusion test results it may be possible to propose that A. agallocha roots should have a medicinal uses especially against E. faecium, L. monocytogenes ATCC 7644, B. subtilis DSMZ 1971, C. albicans DSMZ 1386, S. epidermidis DSMZ 20044 and S. aureus ATCC 25923.",

We examined the therapeutic and preventive potential of andrographolide, which is a lactone diterpenoid from Andrographis paniculata, and focused on the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)/ nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2)-mediated heme oxygenase (HO)-1 - inducing effects and the inhibitory activity of amyloid beta (Aβ)42 - induced microglial activation related to Nrf2 and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-mediated inflammatory responses. Andrographolide induced the expression and translocation of Nrf2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, thereby activating antioxidant response element (ARE) gene transcription and HO-1 expression in murine hippocampal HT22 cells. Andrographolide eliminated intracellular Aβ42 in BV-2 cells and decreased the production of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, prostaglandin (PG)E2, and nitric oxide (NO) because of artificial phagocytic Aβ42. It decreased pNF-κB accumulation in the nucleus and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (i-NOS) and cyclooxygenase II (COX-II) in the microglial BV-2 cell line. In summary, andrographolide activates Nrf2 -mediated HO-1 expression and inhibits Aβ42 - overexpressed microglial BV-2 cell activation. These results suggested that andrographolide might have the potential for further examination of the therapeutics of AD.",

      "document": "Clinical and radiographic outcomes of bilateral decompression via a unilateral approach with transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis with stenosis Laminectomy with posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) has been shown to achieve satisfactory clinical outcomes, but it leads to potential adverse consequences associated with extensive disruption of posterior bony and soft tissue structures. This study aimed to compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes of bilateral decompression via a unilateral approach (BDUA) with transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) and laminectomy with PLIF in the treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis (DLS) with stenosis. This is a prospective cohort study. This study compared 43 patients undergoing BDUA + TLIF and 40 patients undergoing laminectomy + PLIF. Visual analog scale (VAS) for low back pain and leg pain, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) score. The clinical outcomes were assessed, and intraoperative data and complications were collected. Radiographic outcomes included slippage of the vertebra, disc space height, segmental lordosis, and final fusion rate. This study was supported by a grant from The National Natural Science Foundation of China (81572168). There were significant improvements in clinical and radiographic outcomes from before surgery to 3 months and 2 years after surgery within each group. Analysis of leg pain VAS and ZCQ scores showed no significant differences in improvement between groups at either follow-up. The mean improvements in low back pain VAS and ODI scores were significantly greater in the BDUA + TLIF group than in the laminectomy + PLIF group. No significant difference was found in the final fusion rate at 2-year follow-up. The BDUA + TLIF group had significantly less blood loss, shorter length of postoperative hospital stay, and lower complication rate compared with the laminectomy + PLIF group. When compared with the conventional laminectomy + PLIF procedure, the BDUA + TLIF procedure achieves similar and satisfactory effects of decompression and fusion for DLS with stenosis. The BDUA + TLIF procedure appears to be associated with less postoperative low back discomfort and quicker recovery.",

      "document": "Highest dominant frequency and rotor positions are robust markers of driver location during noninvasive mapping of atrial fibrillation: A computational study Dominant frequency (DF) and rotor mapping have been proposed as noninvasive techniques to guide localization of drivers maintaining atrial fibrillation (AF). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the robustness of both techniques in identifying atrial drivers noninvasively under the effect of electrical noise or model uncertainties. Inverse - computed DFs and phase maps were obtained from 30 different mathematical AF simulations. Epicardial highest dominant frequency (HDF) regions and rotor location were compared with the same inverse - computed measurements after addition of noise to the ECG, size variations of the atria, and linear or angular deviations in the atrial location inside the thorax. Inverse - computed electrograms (EGMs) individually correlated poorly with the original EGMs in the absence of induced uncertainties (0.45 ± 0.12) and were worse with 10-dB noise (0.22 ± 0.11), 3-cm displacement (0.01 ± 0.02), or 36° rotation (0.02 ± 0.03). However, inverse - computed HDF regions showed robustness against induced uncertainties: from 82% ± 18% match for the best conditions, down to 73% ± 23% for 10-dB noise, 77% ± 21% for 5-cm displacement, and 60% ± 22% for 36° rotation. The distance from the inverse - computed rotor to the original rotor was also affected by uncertainties: 0.8 ± 1.61 cm for the best conditions, 2.4 ± 3.6 cm for 10-dB noise, 4.3 ± 3.2 cm for 4-cm displacement, and 4.0 ± 2.1 cm for 36° rotation. Restriction of rotor detections to the HDF area increased rotor detection accuracy from 4.5 ± 4.5 cm to 3.2 ± 3.1 cm (P <.05) with 0-dB noise. The combination of frequency and phase- derived measurements increases the accuracy of noninvasive localization of atrial rotors driving AF in the presence of noise and uncertainties in atrial location or size.",

      "document": "Intra-articular implantation of collagen scaffold carriers is safe in both native and arthrofibrotic rabbit knee joints Sustained intra-articular delivery of pharmacological agents is an attractive modality but requires use of a safe carrier that would not induce cartilage damage or fibrosis. Collagen scaffolds are widely available and could be used intra-articularly, but no investigation has looked at the safety of collagen scaffolds within synovial joints. The aim of this study was to determine the safety of collagen scaffold implantation in a validated in vivo animal model of knee arthrofibrosis. A total of 96 rabbits were randomly and equally assigned to four different groups: arthrotomy alone; arthrotomy and collagen scaffold placement; contracture surgery; and contracture surgery and collagen scaffold placement. Animals were killed in equal numbers at 72 hours, two weeks, eight weeks, and 24 weeks. Joint contracture was measured, and cartilage and synovial samples underwent histological analysis. Animals that underwent arthrotomy had equivalent joint contractures regardless of scaffold implantation (-13.9° versus -10.9°, equivalence limit 15°). Animals that underwent surgery to induce contracture did not demonstrate equivalent joint contracture s with (41.8°) or without (53.9°) collagen scaffold implantation. Chondral damage occurred in similar rates with (11 of 48) and without (nine of 48) scaffold implantation. No significant difference in synovitis was noted between groups. Absorption of the collagen scaffold occurred within eight weeks in all animals CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that intra-articular implantation of a collagen sponge does not induce synovitis or cartilage damage. Implantation in a native joint does not seem to induce contracture. Implantation of the collagen sponge in a rabbit knee model of contracture may decrease the severity of the contracture .Cite this article: J. A. Walker, T. J. Ewald, E. Lewallen, A. Van Wijnen, A. D.

This study examined the impact of the four stages of internalized stigma on recovery orientation and assessed cognitive insight as a moderator. Data from a community sample of adults with serious mental illness (N = 268) were collected through structured interviews. Regression -based analyses were used to examine the main effects of internalized stigma on recovery orientation and the moderating effect of cognitive insight. Applying stigmatizing beliefs to oneself and the related decrement in self-esteem each predicted decreased recovery orientation. Cognitive insight moderated the effect of self-application of stigmatizing beliefs on recovery orientation. Increasing cognitive insight by fostering flexibility in self-cognitions may help reduce internalized stigma. Interventions may also benefit from addressing the emotional component of internalized stigma, such as feelings of shame. (PsycINFO Database Record",

From 1995 through 2013, 524 patients, 73 (14%) with low-risk, 207 (40%) with intermediate-risk, and 244 (47%) with high-risk prostate cancer, were treated with HDR-BT as monotherapy at 5 institutions in Japan. Dose fractionations were 27 Gy/2 fractions for 69 patients (13%), 45.5 Gy/7 fractions for 168 (32%), 49 Gy/7 fractions for 149 (28%), 54 Gy/9 fractions for 130 (25%), and others for 8 (2%). Of these patients, 156 (30%) did not receive androgen deprivation therapy, and 202 patients (39%) did receive androgen deprivation therapy <1 year, 112 (21%) for 1-3 years, and 54 (10%) for >3 years. Median follow-up time was 5.9 years (range, 0.4-18.1 years), with a minimum of 2 years for surviving patients. After 5 years, respective actuarial rates of no biochemical evidence of disease, overall survival, cause -specific survival, and metastasis - free survival for all patients were 92%, 97%, 99%, and 94%. For low / intermediate / high-risk patients, the 5- year no biochemical evidence of disease rates were 95%/94%/89%, the 5- year overall survival rates were 98%/98%/94%, the 5- year cause -specific survival rates were 98%/100%/98%, and the 5- year metastasis - free survival rates were 98%/95%/90%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of late grade 2 to 3 genitourinary toxicity at 5 years was 19%, and that of late grade 3 was 1%. The corresponding incidences of gastrointestinal toxicity were 3% and 0% (0.2%). No grade 4 or 5 of either type of toxicity was detected. The findings of this nationwide, multicenter, retrospective study demonstrate that HDR-BT as monotherapy was safe and effective for all patients with low-, intermediate-, and high-risk prostate cancer.",

      "document": "Measuring nonlinear signal combination using EEG Relatively little is known about the processes, both linear and nonlinear, by which signals are combined beyond V1. By presenting two stimulus components simultaneously, flickering at different temporal frequencies (frequency tagging) while measuring steady-state visual evoked potentials, we can assess responses to the individual components, including direct measurements of suppression on each other, and various nonlinear responses to their combination found at intermodulation frequencies. The result is a rather rich dataset of frequencies at which responses can be found. We presented pairs of sinusoidal gratings at different temporal frequencies, forming plaid patterns that were \" coherent \" (looking like a checkerboar d) and \" noncoherent \" (looking like a pair of transparently overlaid gratings), and found clear intermodulation responses to compound stimuli, indicating nonlinear summation. This might have been attributed to cross-orientation suppression except that the pattern of intermodulation responses differed for coherent and noncoherent patterns, whereas the effects of suppression (measured at the component frequencies) did not. A two-stage model of nonlinear summation involving conjunction detection with a logical AND gate described the data well, capturing the difference between coherent and noncoherent plaids over a wide array of possible response frequencies. Multistimulus frequency -tagged EEG in combination with computational modeling may be a very valuable tool in studying the conjunction of these signals. In the current study the results suggest a second-order mechanism responding selectively to coherent plaid patterns.",

      "document": "Hepatitis C virus impairs natural killer cell activity via viral serine protease NS3 Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is characterized by a high frequency of chronic cases owing to the impairment of innate and adaptive immune responses. The modulation of natural killer (NK) cell functions by HCV leads to an impaired innate immune response. However, the underling mechanisms and roles of HCV proteins in this immune evasion are controversial, especially in the early phase of HCV infection. To investigate the role of HCV nonstructural proteins especially NS3 in the impairment of NK functions, NK cells were isolated from the PBMCs by negative selection. To assess the direct cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production capability of NK cells, co-cultured with uninfected, HCV-infected, HCV-NS3 DNA - transfected Huh-7.5, or HCV-NS replicon cells. To determine the effect of an NS3 serine protease inhibitor, HCV -infected Huh-7.5 cells were treated with BILN-2061. Then, NK cells were harvested and further co-cultured with K-562 target cells. NK cell functions were analyzed by flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. When co-cultured with HCV-infected Huh-7.5 cells, the natural cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production capability of NK cells were significantly reduced. NK cell functions were inhibited to similar levels upon co-culture with HCV-NS replicon cells, NS3 - transfected cells, and HCV-infected Huh-7.5 cells. These reductions were restored by BILN-2061 - treatment. Furthermore, BILN-2061 - treatment significantly increased degranulation against K-562 target cells and IFN-γ productivity in NK cells. Consistent with these findings, the expression levels of activating NK cell receptors, such as NKp46 and NKp30, were also increased. In HCV-infected cells, the serine protease NS3 may play a role in the abrogation of NK cell functions in the early phase of infection through downregulation of NKp46 and NKp30 receptors on NK cells. Together, these results suggest that NS3 represents a novel drug target for the treatment of HCV infections.",

      "document": "Serotonin and Serotonin Transporters in the Adrenal Medulla: A Potential Hub for Modulation of the Sympathetic Stress Response Serotonin (5-HT) is an important neurotransmitter in the central nervous system where it modulates circuits involved in mood, cognition, movement, arousal, and autonomic function. The 5-HT transporter (SERT; SLC6A4) is a key regulator of 5-HT signaling, and genetic variations in SERT are associated with various disorders including depression, anxiety, and autism. This review focuses on the role of SERT in the sympathetic nervous system. Autonomic / sympathetic dysfunction is evident in patients with depression, anxiety, and other diseases linked to serotonergic signaling. Experimentally, loss of SERT function (SERT knockout mice or chronic pharmacological block) has been reported to augment the sympathetic stress response. Alterations to serotonergic signaling in the CNS and thus central drive to the peripheral sympathetic nervous system are presumed to underlie this augmentation. Although less widely recognized, SERT is robustly expressed in chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla, the neuroendocrine arm of the sympathetic nervous system. Adrenal chromaffin cells do not synthesize 5-HT but accumulate small amounts by SERT -mediated uptake. Recent evidence demonstrated that 5-HT1A receptors inhibit catecholamine secretion from adrenal chromaffin cells via an atypical mechanism that does not involve modulation of cellular excitability or voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels. This raises the possibility that the adrenal medulla is a previously unrecognized peripheral hub for serotonergic control of the sympathetic stress response. As a framework for future investigation, a model is proposed in which stress - evoked adrenal catecholamine secretion is fine-tuned by SERT -modulated autocrine 5-HT signaling.",

      "document": "Pharmacogenomic identification of small molecules for lineage specific manipulation of subventricular zone germinal activity Strategies for promoting neural regeneration are hindered by the difficulty of manipulating desired neural fates in the brain without complex genetic methods. The subventricular zone (SVZ) is the largest germinal zone of the forebrain and is responsible for the lifelong generation of interneuron subtypes and oligodendrocytes. Here, we have performed a bioinformatics analysis of the transcriptome of dorsal and lateral SVZ in early postnatal mice, including neural stem cells (NSCs) and their immediate progenies, which generate distinct neural lineages. We identified multiple signaling pathways that trigger distinct downstream transcriptional networks to regulate the diversity of neural cells originating from the SVZ. Next, we used a novel in silico genomic analysis, searchable platform-independent expression database / connectivity map (SPIED / CMAP), to generate a catalogue of small molecules that can be used to manipulate SVZ microdomain-specific lineages. Finally, we demonstrate that compounds identified in this analysis promote the generation of specific cell lineages from NSCs in vivo, during postnatal life and adulthood, as well as in regenerative contexts. This study unravels new strategies for using small bioactive molecules to direct germinal activity in the SVZ, which has therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative diseases.",

Oncolytic myxoma virus (MYXV) exhibits potent anti-cancer efficacy against human cancers like multiple myeloma (MM) and can arm transplant -derived T cells to become more effective cancer killers in vitro and in an immunodeficient xenotransplant murine model. Here, we tested ex vivo MYXV virotherapy against residual murine MM in immunocompetent mice using an allogeneic mouse-mouse model. In contrast to all human MM cell lines previously tested, the murine MM cell line tested here was highly resistant to direct MYXV infection and oncolysis in vitro. Despite this in vitro resistance, we found that ex vivo MYXV -armed allogeneic bone marrow (BM) transplantation dramatically ablated pre-seeded residual MM in vivo. Unexpectedly, we show that both neutrophils and activated T cells from the donor function as virus-armed carrier cells, and MYXV -preloaded cells enhanced MM killing. Our results demonstrate a novel therapeutic paradigm for residual cancer, in which multiple classes of allotransplant leukocytes can be armed by MYXV ex vivo to enhance the graft-versus-tumor effects.",

Adult vascular risk factors and socioeconomic status (SES) are associated with increased risk, but less is known about early life risk factors, such as education, childhood SES, or intelligence (IQ). We comprehensively searched Medline, PsycINFO and EMBASE from inception to November 2015. We included all studies reporting data on >50 strokes examining childhood /premorbid IQ, SES, and education. Two reviewers independently screened full texts and extracted and cross-checked data, including available risk-factor adjustments. We meta-analyzed stroke risk using hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR) and mean differences (MD). We tested effects of study and participant characteristics in sensitivity analyses and meta-regression, and assessed heterogeneity and publication bias. We identified 90 studies examining stroke risk and education (79), SES (10), or IQ (nine) including approximately 161,001 stroke and over 5 million stroke-free participants. Stroke risk increased with lower education (OR =1.35, 95% CI =1.24 to 1.48), SES (OR =1.28, 95% CI =1.12 to 1.46) and IQ (HR =1.17, 95% CI =1.00 to 1.37) in studies reporting point estimates, with similar associations for MD. We found minimal publication bias. Between-study heterogeneity was partly explained by participant age and case ascertainment method. Education, childhood SES and intelligence have modest but important associations with lifetime stroke, and hence dementia, risks. Future studies distinguishing between the individual and combined effects of education, childhood SES and intelligence are needed to determine the independent contribution of each factor to stroke risk.",

      "document": "Repeated local emergence of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in a single hospital ward We recently reported a dramatic increase in the prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a Vietnamese hospital. This upsurge was associated with a specific oxa23 -positive clone that was identified by multilocus VNTR analysis. Here, we used whole-genome sequence analysis to dissect the emergence of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii causing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in the ICU during 2009-2012. To provide historical context and distinguish microevolution from strain introduction, we compared these genomes with those of A. baumannii asymptomatic carriage and VAP isolates from this same ICU collected during 2003-2007. We identified diverse lineages co-circulating over many years. Carbapenem resistance was associated with the presence of oxa23, oxa40, oxa58 and ndm1 genes in multiple lineages. The majority of resistant isolates were oxa23 -positive global clone GC2; fine-scale phylogenomic analysis revealed five distinct GC2 sublineages within the ICU that had evolved locally via independent chromosomal insertions of oxa23 transposons. The increase in infections caused by carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii was associated with transposon -mediated transmission of a carbapenemase gene, rather than clonal expansion or spread of a carbapenemase -harbouring plasmid. Additionally, we found evidence of homologous recombination creating diversity within the local GC2 population, including several events resulting in replacement of the capsule locus. We identified likely donors of the imported capsule locus sequences amongst the A. baumannii isolated on the same ward, suggesting that diversification was largely facilitated via reassortment and sharing of genetic material within the localized A. baumannii population.",

      "document": "A New Classification of Three-Dimensional Printing Technologies: Systematic Review of Three-Dimensional Printing for Patient -Specific Craniomaxillofacial Surgery Three-dimensional printing technology has been advancing in surgical applications. This systematic review examines its patient -specific applications in craniomaxillofacial surgery. Terms related to \" three-dimensional printing \" and \" surgery \" were searched on PubMed on May 4, 2015; 313 unique articles were returned. Inclusion and exclusion criteria concentrated on patient -specific surgical applications, yielding 141 full-text articles, of which 33 craniomaxillofacial articles were analyzed. Thirty-three articles included 315 patients who underwent three-dimensional printing -assisted operations. The most common modeling software was Mimics, the most common printing software was 3D Systems, the average time to create a printed object was 18.9 hours (range, 1.5 to 96 hours), and the average cost of a printed object was $1353.31 (range, $69.75 to $5500). Surgical procedures were divided among 203 craniofacial patients (205 three-dimensional printing objects) and 112 maxillofacial patients (137 objects). Printing technologies could be classified as contour models, guides, splints, and implants. For craniofacial patients, 173 contour models (84 percent), 13 guides (6 percent), two splints (1 percent), and 17 implants (8 percent) were made. For maxillofacial patients, 41 contour models (30 percent), 48 guides (35 percent), 40 splints (29 percent), and eight implants (6 percent) were made. These distributions were significantly different (p < 0.0001). Four studies compared three-dimensional printing techniques to conventional techniques; two of them found that three-dimensional printing produced improved outcomes. Three-dimensional printing technology in craniomaxillofacial surgery can be classified into contour models (type I), guides (type II), splints (type III), and implants (type IV). These four methods vary in their use between craniofacial and maxillofacial surgery, reflecting their different goals. This understanding may help advance and predict three-dimensional printing applications for other types of plastic surgery and beyond.",

      "document": "Pathways to Suicide in Australian Farmers: A Life Chart Analysis Farmers have been found to be at increased risk of suicide in Australia. The Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicidal Behaviour suggests that the proximal factors leading to the suicidal desire or ideation include an individual's experiences of both perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness. Suicidal desire with acquired capability to engage in lethal self-injury is predictive of suicidal behaviour. This study investigates the pathways to suicide of 18 Australian male farmers in order to understand the suicidal process and antecedents to suicide in Australian male farmers. The psychological autopsy (PA) method was used to generate life charts. Two pathways with distinct suicidal processes were identified: acute situational (romantic relationship problems and financial concerns / pending retirement) and protracted (long-term psychiatric disorder). Long working hours, interpersonal conflicts, physical illnesses and pain, alcohol abuse, access to firearms, and exposure to drought were additional common factors identified. An understanding of the interrelatedness of diverse distal and proximal risk factors on suicidal pathways in the wider environmental context for male farmers is required when developing and implementing rural suicide prevention activities.",

      "document": "CS - PEG decorated PLGA nano-prototype for delivery of bioactive compounds: A novel approach for induction of apoptosis in HepG2 cell line Polymer - based nanoparticles are used as vectors for cancer drug delivery. The bioactive compounds (quercetin, ellagic acid and gallic acid) are well known to be not only antioxidants but also chemopreventive candidates against various types of cancers. To circumvent the low bioavailability and the short half-life time obstacles, we hypothesized a novel PLGA nano-platform functionalized with CS and PEG to encapsulate these phytochemicals. This encapsulation will protect the compounds from the phagocytic uptake and deliver PLGA-CS-PEG nano-prototype with high biodegradability and biosafety. Three consequent types of PLGA-based nanocomposites were prepared and characterized. Furthermore, we investigated the newly synthesized nano-formulations against human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and colorectal cancer (HCT 116) cell lines using cell growth inhibition assays, followed by apoptosis and necrosis assays using flow cytometry to detect the underlying mechanism of HepG2 cell death. Through Malvern Zeta Sizer, we recorded that the average diameters of the nano-prototypes ranged from 150 to 300nm. The cytotoxic activity of quercetin, ellagic acid, and gallic acid - encapsulated PLGA, PLGA-CS, and PLGA-CS-PEG nano-prototypes it has been found that they reduce the IC50s of the HepG2 cells values by 2.2, 2.9, 2.8- folds, 1, 1.5, 2.7- folds, and 0.9, 0.7, 1.5- folds, respectively. Mechanistically, the nano-platforms of quercetin seem to be dependent on both apoptosis and necrosis, while those of ellagic acid and gallic acid are mainly dependent on apoptosis. CS - PEG -blended PLGA nano-delivery system of quercetin, ellagic acid and gallic acid can potentiate apoptosis-mediated cell death in HepG2 cell line.",

Patients with BNP ≥200 pg/mL (High - BNP, n=170) had more advanced HF characteristics, including lower EF (25.0±8.6% vs. 28.1±8.0%, P=0.0008), than those with BNP <200 pg/mL. In the High - BNP patients, peak oxygen uptake (V̇O2) was significantly increased by 8.3±16.2% during the ET program, and changes in peak V̇O2 inversely correlated with changes in BNP (R=-0.453, P<0.0001) and changes in ventilatory efficiency (V̇E / V̇CO2 slope) (R=-0.439, P<0.0001). During a median follow-up of 46 months, patients in the upper tertile of changes in peak V̇O2 (≥13.0%), compared with those in the lower tertile (<1.0%), had lower rates of the composite of all-cause death or HF hospitalization (37.9% vs. 54.4%, P=0.036) and all-cause death (8.6% vs. 24.6%, P=0.056). In the multivariate analysis, change in peak V̇O2 was a significant independent predictor of the composite outcome and all-cause death. Even among advanced HF p atient s with high BNP level, an ET program significantly improved exercise capacity, and a greater improvement in exercise capacity was associated with greater decreases in BNP level and V̇E / V̇CO2 slope and more favorable long-term clinical outcomes.",

In this mechanism larger dissipation and copying velocity result in improved copying accuracy. We consider a model of a polymerase which simultaneously copies a single-stranded RNA and opens a single- to double-stranded junction serving as an obstacle. The presence of the obstacle slows down the motor, resulting in a change of its fidelity, which can be used to gain information about the motor and junction dynamics. We find that the motor's fidelity does not depend on details of the motor-junction interaction, such as whether the interaction is passive or active. Analysis of the copying fidelity can still be used as a tool for investigating the junction kinetics.",

Fish ectoparasites make initial contact with their hosts at body surfaces, such as skin and gills, which are covered with mucosa that are similar to those of mammalian guts. Fish are among the most primitive vertebrates with immune systems that are equivalent to those in mammals, and they produce and secrete IgM into mucus. In this study, we showed that the monogenean parasite Heterobothrium okamotoi utilizes IgM to recognize its host, fugu Takifugu rubripes Oncomiracidia are infective larvae of H. okamotoi that shed their cilia and metamorphose into juveniles when exposed to purified d-mannose - binding fractions from fugu mucus. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, proteins contained in the fraction were identified as d-mannose -specific IgM with two d-mannose -binding lectins. However, although deciliation was significantly induced by IgM and was inhibited by d-mannose or a specific Ab against fugu IgM, other lectins had no effect, and IgM without d-mannose affinity induced deciliation to a limited degree. Subsequent immunofluorescent staining experiments showed that fugu d-mannose -specific IgM binds ciliated epidermal cells of oncomiracidium. These observations suggest that deciliation is triggered by binding of fugu IgM to cell surface Ags via Ag binding sites. Moreover, concentrations of d-mannose - binding IgM in gill mucus were sufficient to induce deciliation in vitro, indicating that H. okamotoi parasites initially use host Abs to colonize host gills.",

To determine pain control and side effects after gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for classical idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia (TN) with or without neurovascular compression (NVC). This study included 47 patients with type 1 idiopathic TN and Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) pain class IV or V that were treated with GKRS, with maximal dose of 85 Gy targeting root entry zone, as a first-treatment modality between January 2005 and March 2015. A retrospective analysis was made of NVC status, pain control, side effects, recurrence, and cross-sectional area. During the median 21.5 months follow-up (range, 3-119 months), 36 (76.6%) patients showed good outcomes (improved to below BNI class IIIa). Twenty two patients did not show NVC (group A) and 25 had NVC present (group B). Good outcomes were not different in two groups (group A: 19/22; group B: 17/25)(p = 0.138). The numbers of cases in BNI class I or II, and recurrences were not different (p = 0.532, 0.786, respectively). The mean areas were 8.64 ± 2.59 mm3 in non-deviated cases (n = 27) and 2.59 ± 1.68 mm3 in deviated (n = 10). Side effects were significantly more frequent in deviated cases (8/10; 80%) than in non-deviated (7/27; 25.9%) (p = 0.003). NVC is not a predictive factor for pain control after GKRS for the treatment of idiopathic TN. Side effects may occur more frequently in patients with NVC at the target coordinate when a root entry zone is used, but the subjective symptoms are not always bothersome.",

Our objective was to present five adult cases with emphasis on imaging findings and long-term evolution. From 2006 to 2014, we included 5 HIV - infected patients presenting with fusiform cerebral aneurysms. Vessels abnormalities were assessed with brain computed tomography (CT) angiography, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and/or digital subtraction angiography (DSA). All patients had MR assessment of the brain. Clinical and biological data were analyzed. Fusiform aneurysms of carotid terminations extending to middle and anterior cerebral arteries were bilateral in three patients and unilateral in one. More distal fusiform aneurysms were observed in four patients and saccular aneurysms in two patients, two patients suffered from ischemic lesions while none experienced hemorrhage.

Here, we provide a series of laboratory and field experiments to assess the role of zucchini in the host plant expansion of cotton - specialized aphids. We observed that cotton - specialized aphids possessed the ability to expand on a new host plant (cucumber), with individuals first recorded on June 12 and consequently increasing exponentially in number in a field cage. A bioassay experiment showed that aphids from both cotton and cucumber preferred their natal host, but clones from zucchini have a stronger preference for cucumber than cotton or zucchini. A total of 1512 individuals were collected from a cotton field (mixed cotton and cucurbit plot), cotton farmland (cotton alone) and a field cage and sequenced to identify their biotypes. The results for apterous individuals from the cotton field showed that more cucurbit - specialized biotypes occurred on cucumber and more cotton - specialized biotypes occurred on cotton and zucchini. A majority (> 97.0%) of aphids from both the field cage and cotton farmland were cotton - specialized individuals. Consequently, eliminating intermediate host plants may be an effective measure to suppress A. gossypii outbreaks, because cotton and cucumber are often grown together in fields and greenhouses.",

In this study, we combine multiplex PCR, custom designed dual indexing and Miseq sequencing for high throughput SNP - profiling of 457 malaria infections from Guinea-Bissau, at the cost of 10 USD per sample. By amplifying and sequencing 15 genetic fragments, we cover 20 resistance -conferring SNPs occurring in pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, pfdhps, as well as the entire length of pfK13, and the mitochondrial barcode for parasite origin. SNPs of interest were sequenced with an average depth of 2,043 reads, and bases were called for the various SNP - positions with a p-value below 0.05, for 89.8-100% of samples. The SNP data indicates that artemisinin resistance -conferring SNPs in pfK13 are absent from the studied area of Guinea-Bissau, while the pfmdr1 86 N allele is found at a high prevalence. The mitochondrial barcodes are unanimous and accommodate a West African origin of the parasites. With this method, very reliable high throughput surveillance of antimalarial drug resistance becomes more affordable than ever before.",

Safe and effective drugs are urgently needed for the treatment of OA. Previous study reported that Astragaloside IV (ASG-IV) had exerted a protective effect against articular cartilage degeneration by promoting rapid proliferation of chondrocyte. Therefore, the aim of our study is to explore the effects and mechanisms of ASG-IV in chondrocyte apoptosis. Isobaric Tags For Relative And Absolute Quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomics was used to quantitatively detect and map proteins in SW1353 chondrocyte-like cells pre-treated with ASG-IV or interleukin-1β (IL-1β) or ASG-IV + IL-1β. The iTRAQ-labeled peptides were fractionated by high-accuracy liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Cell apoptosis and differentially expressed proteins was detected by flow cytometry (FCM), quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and western blotting, respectively. The apoptosis of the IL-1β - induced SW1353 cells treated with ASG-IV was greatly inhibited. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that gamma actin 1 (ACTG1) and Yes Associated Protein 1 (YAP1), participating in the Hippo signaling pathway and Vitronectin (VTN) and Collagen Type I Alpha 1 Chain (COL1A1), involving in the extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction signaling pathway, were all significantly up-regulated in the IL-1β - induced SW1353 cells after treatment with ASG-IV. The qRT-PCR and Western blotting results confirmed the up-regulation of these four genes. ASG-IV played a positive role in human osteoarthritic chondrocyte apoptosis, possibly through modulation of the Hippo signaling pathway by up-regulating YAP1 and ACTG1 expression, and also by up-regulating VTN and COL1A1, which are involved in the ECM-receptor interaction pathway. Taken together, all the results suggested that ASG-IV had a novel therapeutic potential for the treatment of OA.",

      "document": "Self - assembled nanocomplex between polymerized phenylboronic acid and doxorubicin for efficient tumor - targeted chemotherapy Since the discovery that nano-scaled particulates can easily be incorporated into tumors via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, such nanostructures have been exploited as therapeutic small molecule delivery systems. However, the convoluted synthetic process of conventional nanostructures has impeded their feasibility and reproducibility in clinical applications. Herein, we report an easily prepared formulation of self - assembled nanostructures for systemic delivery of the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). Phenylboronic acid (PBA) was grafted onto the polymeric backbone of poly(maleic anhydride). pPBA-DOX nanocomplexes were prepared by simple mixing, on the basis of the strong interaction between the 1,3-diol of DOX and the PBA moiety on pPBA. Three nanocomplexes (1, 2, 4) were designed on the basis of [PBA]:[DOX] molar ratios of 1:1, 2:1, and 4:1, respectively, to investigate the function of the residual PBA moiety as a targeting ligand. An acid-labile drug release profile was observed, owing to the intrinsic properties of the phenylboronic ester. Moreover, the tumor - targeting ability of the nanocomplexes was demonstrated, both in vitro by confocal microscopy and in vivo by fluorescence imaging, to be driven by an inherent property of the residual PBA. Ligand competition assays with free PBA pre-treatment demonstrated the targeting effect of the residual PBA from the nanocomplexes 2 and 4. Finally, the nanocomplexes 2 and 4, compared with the free DOX, exhibited significantly greater anti-cancer effects in vitro and even in vivo. Our pPBA-DOX nanocomplex enables a new paradigm for self - assembled nanostructures with potential biomedical applications.",

      "document": "Stalk versus base invasion in pT1 papillary cancers of the bladder: improved substaging system predicting risk of progression Pathologic stage T1 (pT1) bladder cancers are a clinically heterogeneous group. However, current staging guidelines for superficially invasive cancers do not acknowledge the variability in type and extent of lamina propria invasion in papillary urothelial carcinomas (PUC), and historically proposed substaging systems showed either high inter-observer variation or limited value in predicting patient outcomes. Herein we reappraise pT1 PUC substaging, aiming to identify a novel scheme which is reproducible and prognostically meaningful. Stage pT1 PUC diagnosed during years 1999-2015 were retrospectively reviewed and characterized as focal invasion confined to papillary stalk, focal invasion of tumor base, or extensive invasion of tumor base. Cases with concurrent flat carcinoma in-situ, angiolymphatic invasion, absent muscularis propria, or clinically advanced disease were excluded. We calculated cumulative incidence of recurrence, progression, and death by tumor subtype and evaluated differential risks using log-rank tests and Kaplan-Meier curves stratified by type and extent of invasion. Among 62 patients satisfying inclusion criteria, 22 of 29 patients with base extensive invasion progressed while 4 of 13 with base focal and 0 of 20 with stalk only invasion progressed. There was strong evidence that base extensive patients had higher risk of progression and death due to bladder cancer than base focal or stalk only counterparts (P<0.0001). However, tumor subtype was not significantly associated with risk of recurrence (P=0.21). We propose an innovative substaging approach for reporting site and extent of lamina propria invasion in patients with pT1 PUC allowing patient stratification for risk of progression.

      "document": "The WW domain of the scaffolding protein IQGAP1 is neither necessary nor sufficient for binding to the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2 Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) scaffold proteins, such as IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1), are promising targets for novel therapies against cancer and other diseases. Such approaches require accurate information about which domains on the scaffold protein bind to the kinases in the MAPK cascade. Results from previous studies have suggested that the WW domain of IQGAP1 binds to the cancer -associated MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2, and that this domain might thus offer a new tool to selectively inhibit MAPK activation in cancer cells. The goal of this work was therefore to critically evaluate which IQGAP1 domains bind to ERK1 / 2. Here, using quantitative in vitro binding assays, we show that the IQ domain of IQGAP1 is both necessary and sufficient for binding to ERK1 and ERK2, as well as to the MAPK kinases MEK1 and MEK2. Furthermore, we show that the WW domain is not required for ERK - IQGAP1 binding, and contributes little or no binding energy to this interaction, challenging previous models of how WW-based peptides might inhibit tumorigenesis. Finally, we show that the ERK2 - IQGAP1 interaction does not require ERK2 phosphorylation or catalytic activity and does not involve known docking recruitment sites on ERK2, and we obtain an estimate of the dissociation constant (Kd) for this interaction of 8 μm These results prompt a re-evaluation of published findings and a refined model of IQGAP scaffolding.",

      "document": "Increased cerebral blood volume pulsatility during head-down tilt with elevated carbon dioxide: The SPACECOT Study Astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) have exhibited hyperopic shifts, posterior eye globe flattening, dilated optic nerve sheaths, and even optic disc swelling from spaceflight. Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) consequent to cephalad fluid shifts is commonly hypothesized as contributing to these ocular changes. Head-down tilt (HDT) is frequently utilized as an Earth -based analog to study similar fluid shifts. Sealed environments like the ISS also exhibit elevated carbon dioxide (CO2), a potent arteriolar vasodilator that could further affect cerebral blood volume and flow, intracranial compliance, and ICP. A collaborative pilot study between the National Space Biomedical Research Institute and the German Aerospace Center tested the hypotheses that: (1) HDT and elevated CO2 physiologically interact, and (2) cerebrovascular pulsatility is related to HDT and/or elevated CO2 In a double-blind crossover study (n=6), we measured cerebral blood volume (CBV) pulsatility via near-infrared spectroscopy, alongside non-invasive ICP and intraocular pressure (IOP) during 28-hr -12° HDT at both nominal (0.04%) and elevated (0.5%) ambient CO2 In our cohort, CBV pulsatility increased significantly over time at cardiac frequencies (0.031±0.009 μM/hr increase in [HbT] pulsatility amplitude) and Mayer wave frequencies (0.019±0.005 μM/hr increase). The HDT - CO2 interaction on pulsatility was not robust, but rather driven by an individual. Significant differences between atmospheres were not detected in ICP or IOP. Further work is needed to reproduce these findings in a larger cohort, to determine whether a \"water hammer\" effect in cerebral pulsatility is also present during spaceflight, and whether it is associated with ocular changes in astronauts.",

Merr.] Using ISSR and SSR Markers Inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to assess the genetic diversity of 36 pineapple accessions that were introduced from 10 countries / regions. Thirteen ISSR primers amplified 96 bands, of which 91 (93.65%) were polymorphic, whereas 20 SSR primers amplified 73 bands, of which 70 (96.50%) were polymorphic. Nei's gene diversity (h = 0.28), Shannon's information index (I = 0.43), and polymorphism information content (PIC = 0.29) generated using the SSR primers were higher than that with ISSR primers (h = 0.23, I = 0.37, PIC = 0.24), thereby suggesting that the SSR system is more efficient than the ISSR system in assessing genetic diversity in various pineapple accessions. Mean genetic similarities were 0.74, 0.61, and 0.69, as determined using ISSR, SSR, and combined ISSR / SSR, respectively. These results suggest that the genetic diversity among pineapple accessions is very high. We clustered the 36 pineapple accessions into three or five groups on the basis of the phylogenetic trees constructed based on the results of ISSR, SSR, and combined ISSR / SSR analyses using the unweighted pair-group with arithmetic averaging (UPGMA) method. The results of principal components analysis (PCA) also supported the UPGMA clustering. These results will be useful not only for the scientific conservation and management of pineapple germplasm but also for the improvement of the current pineapple breeding strategies.",

      "document": "Effects of Environmental Factors and Metallic Electrodes on AC Electrical Conduction Through DNA Molecule Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is one of the best candidate materials for various device applications such as in electrodes for rechargeable batteries, biosensors, molecular electronics, medical - and biomedical - applications etc. Hence, it is worthwhile to examine the mechanism of charge transport in the DNA molecule, however, still a question without a clear answer is DNA a molecular conducting material (wire), semiconductor, or insulator? The answer, after the published data, is still ambiguous without any confirmed and clear scientific answer. DNA is found to be always surrounded with different electric charges, ions, and dipoles. These surrounding charges and electric barrier(s) due to metallic electrodes (as environmental factors (EFs)) play a substantial role when measuring the electrical conductivity through λ-double helix (DNA) molecule suspended between metallic electrodes. We found that strong frequency dependence of AC - complex conductivity comes from the electrical conduction of EFs. This leads to superimposing serious incorrect experimental data to measured ones. At 1 MHz, we carried out a first control experiment on electrical conductivity with and without the presence of DNA molecule. If there are possible electrical conduction due to stray ions and contribution of substrate, we will detected them. This control experiment revealed that there is an important role played by the environmental - charges around DNA molecule and any experiment should consider this role. We have succeeded to measure both electrical conductivity due to EFs (σ ENV) and electrical conductivity due to DNA molecule (σ DNA) independently by carrying the measurements at different DNA - lengths and subtracting the data. We carried out measurements as a function of frequency (f) and temperature (T) in the ranges 0.1 Hz < f < 1 MHz and 288 K < T < 343 K. The measured conductivity (σ MES) portrays a metal -like behavior at high frequencies near 1 MHz. However, we found that σ DNA was far from this behavior because the conduction due to EFs superimposes σ DNA, in particular at low frequencies. By measuring the electrical conductivity at different lengths: 40, 60, 80, and 100 nm, we have succeeded not only to separate the electrical conduction of the DNA molecule from all EFs effects that surround the molecule, but also to present accurate values of σ DNA and the dielectric constant of the molecule ε'DNA as a function of temperature and frequency. Furthermore, in order to explain these data, we present a model describing the electrical conduction through DNA molecule: DNA is a classical semiconductor with charges, dipoles and ions that result in creation of localized energy - states (LESs) in the extended bands and in the energy gap of the DNA molecule. This model explains clearly the mechanism of charge transfer mechanism in the DNA, and it sheds light on why the charge transfer through the DNA can lead to insulating, semiconducting, or metallic behavior on the same time. The model considers charges on DNA, in the extended bands, either could be free to move under electric field or localized in potential wells/hills. Localization of charges in DNA is an intrinsic structural - property of this solitaire molecule. At all temperatures, the expected increase in thermal - induced charge is attributed to the delocalization of holes (or/and electrons) in potential hills (or/and potential wells) which accurately accounts for the total electric and dielectric behavior through DNA molecule. We succeeded to fit the experiment al data to the proposed model with reasonable magnitudes of potential hills/wells that are in the energy range from 0.068 eV.",

      "document": "Polymer brush - functionalized chitosan hydrogels as antifouling implant coatings Implantable sensor devices require coatings that efficiently interface with the tissue environment to mediate biochemical analysis. In this regard, bioinspired polymer hydrogels offer an attractive and abundant source of coating materials. However, upon implantation these materials generally elicit inflammation and the foreign body reaction as a consequence of protein fouling on their surface and concomitant poor hemocompatibility. In this report we investigate a strategy to endow chitosan hydrogel coatings with antifouling properties by the grafting of polymer brushes in a \" grafting-from \" approach. Chitosan coatings were functionalized with polymer brushes of oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate using photoinduced single electron transfer living radical polymerization and the surfaces were thoroughly characterized by XPS, AFM, water contact angle goniometry, and in situ ellipsometry. The antifouling properties of these new bioinspired hydrogel-brush coatings were investigated by surface plasmon resonance. The influence of the modifications to the chitosan on hemocompatibility was assessed by contacting the surfaces with platelets and leukocytes. The coatings were hydrophilic and reached a thickness of up to 180 nm within 30 min of polymerization. The functionalization of the surface with polymer brushes significantly reduced the protein fouling and eliminated platelet activation and leukocyte adhesion. This methodology offers a facile route to functionalizing implantable sensor systems with antifouling coatings that improve hemocompatibility and pave the way for enhanced device integration in tissue.",

      "document": "Basic science and pathogenesis of ageing with HIV: potential mechanisms and biomarkers : The increased prevalence of age -related comorbidities and mortality is worrisome in ageing HIV-infected patients. Here, we aim to analyse the different ageing mechanisms with regard to HIV infection. Ageing results from the time - dependent accumulation of random cellular damage. Epigenetic modifications and mitochondrial DNA haplogroups modulate ageing. In antiretroviral treatment -controlled patients, epigenetic clock appears to be advanced, and some haplogroups are associated with HIV infection severity. Telomere shortening is enhanced in HIV-infected patients because of HIV and some nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Mitochondria -related oxidative stress and mitochondrial DNA mutations are increased during ageing and also by some nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Overall, increased inflammation or ' inflammageing ' is a major driver of ageing and could result from cell senescence with secreted proinflammatory mediators, altered gut microbiota, and coinfections. In HIV-infected patients, the level of inflammation and innate immunity activation is enhanced and related to most comorbidities and to mortality. This status could result, in addition to age, from the virus itself or viral protein released from reservoirs, from HIV -enhanced gut permeability and dysbiosis, from antiretroviral treatment, from frequent cytomegalovirus and hepatitis C virus coinfections, and also from personal and environmental factors, as central fat accumulation or smoking. Adaptive immune activation and immunosenescence are associated with comorbidities and mortality in the general population but are less predictive in HIV-infected patients. Biomarkers to evaluate ageing in HIV-infected patients are required. Numerous systemic or cellular inflammatory, immune activation, oxidative stress, or senescence markers can be tested in serum or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The novel European Study to Establish Biomarkers of Human Ageing MARK-AGE algorithm, evaluating the biological age, is currently assessed in HIV-infected patients and reveals an advanced biological age. Some enhanced inflammatory or innate immune activation markers are interesting but still not validated for the patient's follow-up. To be able to assess patients ' biological age is an important objective to improve their healthspan.",

A meta-analysis The promoter region of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene is hypermethylated in several types of cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The prevalence of methylation in the promoter region of this gene in tumor tissues and autologous controls has not been consistent in previous studies. We evaluated the frequency of APC gene promoter 1A methylation between tumor tissues and autologous controls in NSCLC patients by meta-analysis. Open published studies of APC gene promoter 1A methylation between tumor tissues and autologous samples in NSCLC patients were identified using a systematic search. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of APC gene promoter 1A methylation in lung cancer tissues versus autologous controls were calculated. Fourteen studies, involving a total of 1345 patients and 2182 samples, were finally included. The pooled proportion of APC promoter 1A methylation was 0.62 (95% CI 0.52-072) and 0.34 (95% CI 0.21-0.50) in cancer tissues and autologous controls, respectively. The APC gene promoter 1A methylation rate in cancer tissues was much higher than in autologous controls, with a pooled OR of 3.66 (95% CI 2.12-6.33). A strong and significant correlation of APC gene promoter 1A methylation between tumor tissues and autologous controls was detected (correlation coefficient rpearson = 0.77; P = 0.0013). The proportion of APC promoter 1A methylation in lung cancer tissues was higher than in autologous controls, indicating that promoter 1A methylation of the APC gene may play an important role in NSCLC carcinogenesis.",

We review recent literature on drug-drug interactions between nalmefene and opioids that lead to precipitated opioid withdrawal, and focus on its management and planning for care at discharge. Areas covered: This article provides a brief and comprehensive review of management of precipitated opioid withdrawal syndrome when nalmefene is associated with an opioid, whether misused or legally prescribed. Expert opinion: When treating an opiate - dependent patient with co-occurring alcohol use disorder, both conditions need to be a focus of clinical attention. New drugs for alcohol use disorder have been approved, but must be given cautiously and with a full understanding of their potential drug-drug interactions with opioid medications. Opiate - dependent patients should be intensively monitored for risk factors of alcohol use disorder and should be continuously motivated for treatment maintenance. When nalmefene is administered to opiate - dependent patients, acute opioid withdrawal syndrome may occur. Management of precipitated acute opioid withdrawal may include short or long-acting µ-opioid agonists during hospitalization, in addition to supportive treatment. The best management of polydrug abusers is based on a multidisciplinary approach, which should be pursued and improved through continuing medical education.",

      "document": "Acute kidney injury and fluid overload in infants and children after cardiac surgery Acute kidney injury is a common and serious complication after congenital heart surgery, particularly among infants. This comorbidity has been independently associated with adverse outcomes including an increase in mortality. Postoperative acute kidney injury has a complex pathophysiology with many risk factors, and therefore no single medication or therapy has been demonstrated to be effective for treatment or prevention. However, it has been established that the associated fluid overload is one of the major determinants of morbidity, particularly in infants after cardiac surgery. Therefore, in the absence of an intervention to prevent acute kidney injury, much of the effort to improve outcomes has focused on treating and preventing fluid overload. Early renal replacement therapy, often in the form of peritoneal dialysis, has been shown to be safe and beneficial in infants with oliguria after heart surgery. As understanding of the pathophysiology of acute kidney injury and the ability to confidently diagnose it earlier continues to evolve, it is likely that novel preventative and therapeutic interventions will be available in the future.",

      "document": "Interplant Aboveground Signaling Prompts Upregulation of Auxin Promoter and Malate Transporter as Part of Defensive Response in the Neighboring Plants When disrupted by stimuli such as herbivory, pathogenic infection, or mechanical wounding, plants secrete signals such as root exudates and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The emission of VOCs induces a response in the neighboring plant communities and can improve plant fitness by alerting nearby plants of an impending threat and prompting them to alter their physiology for defensive purposes. In this study, we investigated the role of plant -derived signals, released as a result of mechanical wounding, that may play a role in intraspecific communication between Arabidopsis thaliana communities. Plant -derived signals released by the wounded plant resulted in more elaborate root development in the neighboring, unwounded plants. Such plant -derived signals also upregulated the Aluminum-activated malate transporter (ALMT1) responsible for the secretion of malic acid (MA) and the DR5 promoter, an auxin responsive promoter concentrated in root apex of the neighboring plants. We speculate that plant -derived signal - induced upregulation of root -specific ALMT1 in the undamaged neighboring plants sharing the environment with stressed plants may associate more with the benign microbes belowground. We also observed increased association of beneficial bacterium Bacillus subtilis UD1022 on roots of the neighboring plants sharing environment with the damaged plants. Wounding-induced plant -derived signals therefore induce defense mechanisms in the undamaged, local plants, eliciting a two-pronged preemptive response of more rapid root growth and up-regulation of ALMT1, resulting in increased association with beneficial microbiome.",

      "document": "A bio-cultural approach to the study of food choice: The contribution of taste genetics, population and culture The study of food choice, one of the most complex human traits, requires an integrated approach that takes into account environmental, socio-cultural and biological diversity. We recruited 183 volunteers from four geo-linguistic groups and highly diversified in terms of both genetic background and food habits from whom we collected genotypes and phenotypes tightly linked to taste perception. We confirmed previous genetic associations, in particular with stevioside perception, and noted significant differences in food consumption: in particular, broccoli, mustard and beer consumption scores were significantly higher (Adjusted P = 0.02, Adjusted P < 0.0001 and Adjusted P = 0.01, respectively) in North Europeans, when compared to the other groups. Licorice and Parmesan cheese showed lower consumption and liking scores in the Sri Lankan group (Adjusted P = 0.001 and Adjusted P < 0.001, respectively). We also highlighted how rs860170 (TAS2R16) strongly differentiated populations and was associated to salicin bitterness perception. Identifying genetic variants on chemosensory receptors that vary across populations and show associations with taste perception and food habits represents a step towards a better comprehension of this complex trait, aimed at improving the individual health status. This is the first study that concurrently explores the contribution of genetics, population diversity and cultural aspects in taste perception and food consumption.",

This study aimed to compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes of bilateral decompression via a unilateral approach (BDUA) with transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) and laminectomy with PLIF in the treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis (DLS) with stenosis. This is a prospective cohort study. This study compared 43 patients undergoing BDUA + TLIF and 40 patients undergoing laminectomy + PLIF. Visual analog scale (VAS) for low back pain and leg pain, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) score. The clinical outcomes were assessed, and intraoperative data and complications were collected. Radiographic outcomes included slippage of the vertebra, disc space height, segmental lordosis, and final fusion rate. This study was supported by a grant from The National Natural Science Foundation of China (81572168). There were significant improvements in clinical and radiographic outcomes from before surgery to 3 months and 2 years after surgery within each group. Analysis of leg pain VAS and ZCQ scores showed no significant differences in improvement between groups at either follow-up. The mean improvements in low back pain VAS and ODI scores were significantly greater in the BDUA + TLIF group than in the laminectomy + PLIF group. No significant difference was found in the final fusion rate at 2-year follow-up. The BDUA + TLIF group had significantly less blood loss, shorter length of postoperative hospital stay, and lower complication rate compared with the laminectomy + PLIF group. When compared with the conventional laminectomy + PLIF procedure, the BDUA + TLIF procedure achieves similar and satisfactory effects of decompression and fusion for DLS with stenosis. The BDUA + TLIF procedure appears to be associated with less postoperative low back discomfort and quicker recovery.",

Methods: A single- center, retrospective cohort study to determine incidence and diagnostic accuracy for Type 2 DN as the primary cause of ESRD (Code 250.40) on the Center for Medicare & Medicaid (CMS) Medical Evidence Report form (CMS2728) submitted at renal replacement therapy initiation. All patients ≥18 years of age with a CMS2728 submitted between 1 March 2006 and 31 March 2015 at a single academic military medical center (ESRD Network 5) were included. Medical records of those with a Code 250.40 diagnosis were reviewed to determine whether they met the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) 2007 criteria for DN. Results: ESRD incidence secondary to Type 2 DN was 18.7% (56/299 individual CMS2728 submissions over 9.09 years). In all, 12/56 (21.4%) did not meet KDOQI criteria for Type 2 DN. Although all had diabetes, those not meeting criteria had shorter disease duration (P = 0.007), were more likely to have active urine sediment (P = 0.006), and were less likely to have macroalbuminuria (P = 0.037) or retinopathy (P = 0.002) prior to ESRD. On exact logistic regression, retinopathy was significantly associated with KDOQI -predicted DN [odds ratio = 19.16 (confidence interval 2.76-223.7), P = 0.0009]. Conclusions: In this single- center cohort, 21.4% identified as having Type 2 DN as the primary cause of ESRD were incorrectly assigned per KDOQI 2007 clinical criteria. If replicated in larger populations, this could have substantial implications regarding the epidemiology of ESRD in the USA.",

      "document": "The WW domain of the scaffolding protein IQGAP1 is neither necessary nor sufficient for binding to the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2 Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) scaffold proteins, such as IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1), are promising targets for novel therapies against cancer and other diseases. Such approaches require accurate information about which domains on the scaffold protein bind to the kinases in the MAPK cascade. Results from previous studies have suggested that the WW domain of IQGAP1 binds to the cancer -associated MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2, and that this domain might thus offer a new tool to selectively inhibit MAPK activation in cancer cells. The goal of this work was therefore to critically evaluate which IQGAP1 domains bind to ERK1 / 2. Here, using quantitative in vitro binding assays, we show that the IQ domain of IQGAP1 is both necessary and sufficient for binding to ERK1 and ERK2, as well as to the MAPK kinases MEK1 and MEK2. Furthermore, we show that the WW domain is not required for ERK - IQGAP1 binding, and contributes little or no binding energy to this interaction, challenging previous models of how WW-based peptides might inhibit tumorigenesis. Finally, we show that the ERK2 - IQGAP1 interaction does not require ERK2 phosphorylation or catalytic activity and does not involve known docking recruitment sites on ERK2, and we obtain an estimate of the dissociation constant (Kd) for this interaction of 8 μm These results prompt a re-evaluation of published findings and a refined model of IQGAP scaffolding.",

This study sought to examine how to best serve this population. Examinations of why ED frequent users present to the ED, what barriers to care exist, and what service offerings may help these patients achieve an optimal level of health were conducted. We performed a prospective study of frequent ED users in an adult only, level 1 trauma center with approximately 90,000 visits per year. Frequent ED users were defined as those who make four or more ED visits in a 12 month period. Participants were administered a piloted structured interview by a trained researcher querying demographics, ED usage, perceived barriers to care, and potential aids to maintaining health. Of 1,523 screened patients, 297 were identified as frequent ED users. One hundred frequent ED users were enrolled. The mean age was 48 years (95% CI 45-51). The majority of subjects were female (64%, 64/100, 95% CI 55-73%), white (61%, 60/98, 95% CI 52-71%) and insured by Medicaid (55%, 47/86, 95% CI 44-65%) or Medicare (23%, 20/86, 95% CI 14-32%). Subjects had a median of 6 ED visits, and 2 inpatient admissions in the past 12 months at this hospital. Most frequent ED users (61%, 59/96, 95% CI 52-71%) stated the primary reason for their visit was that they felt that their health problem could only be treated in an ED. Transportation presented as a major barrier to few patients (7%, 7/95, 95% CI 3-14%). Subjects stated that \" after-hours options, besides the ED for minor health issues \" (63%, 60/95, 95% CI 53-73%) and having \"a nurse to work with you one-on-one to help manage health care needs \" (53%, 50/95, 95% CI 43-63%) would be most helpful in achieving optimal health. This study characterized ED frequent users and identified several opportunities to better serve this population. By understanding barriers to care from the patient perspective, health systems can potentially address unmet needs that prevent wellness in this population.",

      "document": "Cytokine response to the RSV antigen delivered by dendritic cell -directed vaccination in congenic chicken lines Systems of antigen delivery into antigen-presenting cells represent an important novel strategy in chicken vaccine development. In this study, we verified the ability of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) antigens fused with streptavidin to be targeted by specific biotinylated monoclonal antibody (anti-CD205) into dendritic cells and induce virus - specific protective immunity. The method was tested in four congenic lines of chickens that are either resistant or susceptible to the progressive growth of RSV - induced tumors. Our analyses confirmed that the biot-anti-CD205-SA-FITC complex was internalized by chicken splenocytes. In the cytokine expression profile, several significant differences were evident between RSV -challenged progressor and regressor chicken lines. A significant up-regulation of IL-2, IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 expression was detected in immunized chickens of both regressor and progressor groups. Of these cytokines, IL-2 and IL-12 were most up-regulated 14 days post-challenge (dpc), while IL-15 and IL-18 were most up-regulated at 28 dpc. On the contrary, IL-10 expression was significantly down-regulated in all immunized groups of progressor chickens at 14 dpc. We detected significant up-regulation of IL-17 in the group of immunized progressors. LITAF down-regulation with iNOS up-regulation was especially observed in the progressor group of immunized chickens that developed large tumors. Based on the increased expression of cytokines specific for activated dendritic cells, we conclude that our system is able to induce partial stimulation of specific cell types involved in cell-mediated immunity.",

An additional separate group of gingivitis (n=21) and part of periodontitis patients (n=11) were subjected to non-surgical periodontal treatment whereupon changes in salivary CSF-1, IL-34, and MMP-8 levels were determined and related to periodontal outcome. Periodontitis patients displayed higher CSF-1 and MMP-8 levels in saliva compared to healthy, while IL-34 levels were lower. Higher CSF-1 / IL-34 ratio was observed in periodontitis patients compared to healthy. There was a positive correlation between CSF-1 and MMP-8 which both correlated negatively to IL-34, in gingivitis and periodontitis. Clinical periodontal parameters correlated positively to CSF-1, MMP-8, and to the CSF-1 / IL-34 ratio and negatively to IL-34 in periodontitis patients. Following treatment CSF-1 and MMP-8 levels decreased along with clinical improvement in gingivitis patients. CSF-1 and IL-34 are present in saliva and seem to have complementary roles in periodontal disease, IL-34 in steady-state and CSF-1 in inflammation.",

      "document": "Relationship between Occupational Stress, 5-HT2A Receptor Polymorphisms and Mental Health in Petroleum Workers in the Xinjiang Arid Desert: A Cross-Sectional Study At present, there is growing interest in research examining the relationship between occupational stress and mental health. Owing to the socioeconomic impact of occupational stress and the unique environment of petroleum workers in Xinjiang, a cross-sectional study was carried out between April and December 2015 to investigate the relationship between occupational stress, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor (5-HTR2A) genotype, and mental health. A total of 1485 workers were selected. The Symptom Checklist 90 was used to assess nine classes of psychological symptoms. Work-related stressors were evaluated using the Occupational Stress Inventory-Revised Edition. Levels of 5-HTR2A (the Tl02C and A-1438G single nucleotide polymorphism in the 5-HTR2A gene) were measured by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR - RFLP). The findings of the present study revealed a high prevalence rate of mental health problems (40.29%) in petroleum workers stationed in the arid desert, and suggested a strong correlation between occupational stress and mental health. The TC and CC genotype of Tl02C were found to be protective factors against mental health problems (odds ratio (OR) = 0.455, 95% confidence interval (CI): = 0.269-0.771, odds ratio (OR) = 0.340, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.162-0.716). AG and GG genotype of A-1438G [odds ratio (OR) 1 = 2.729, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.433-5.195; odds ratio (OR) 2 = 2.480, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.221-5.037] were revealed as risk factors. These data provide evidence that occupational stress and 5-HTR2A gene polymorphism contributes to the incidence of mental health problems.",

Results from a UK clinical sample Discrepancies are often found between child and parent reports of child psychopathology, nevertheless the role of the child's presenting difficulties in relation to these is underexplored. This study investigates whether parent-child agreement on the conduct and emotional scales of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) varied as a result of certain child characteristics, including the child's presenting problems to clinical services, age and gender. The UK -based sample consisted of 16,754 clinical records of children aged 11-17, the majority of which were female (57%) and White (76%). The dataset was provided by the Child Outcomes Research Consortium, which collects outcome measures from child services across the UK. Clinicians reported the child's presenting difficulties, and parents and children completed the SDQ. Using correlation analysis, the main findings indicated that agreement varied as a result of the child's difficulties for reports of conduct problems, and this seemed to be related to the presence or absence of externalising difficulties in the child's presentation. This was not the case for reports of emotional difficulties. In addition, agreement was higher when reporting problems not consistent with the child's presentation; for instance, agreement on conduct problems was greater for children presenting with internalising problems. Lastly, the children's age and gender did not seem to have an impact on agreement. These findings demonstrate that certain child presenting difficulties, and in particular conduct problems, may be related to informant agreement and need to be considered in clinical practice and research. Trial Registration This study was observational and as such did not require trial registration.",

To assess clinical outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft in women and men with multivessel coronary disease and unprotected left main disease, a pooled analysis (n=3280) was performed using the patient - level data from 3 large randomized trials: SYNTAX (Synergy between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery), PRECOMBAT (Bypass Surgery Versus Angioplasty Using Sirolimus-Eluting Stent in Patients With Left Main Coronary Artery Disease), and BEST (Bypass Surgery and Everolimus-Eluting Stent Implantation in the Treatment of Patients with Multivessel Coronary Artery Disease) trials. The primary end point was all-cause death. Of 3280 patients, 794 patients (24.2%) were women. The median follow-up period was 1806 days (1611-1837 days). In women, a high heterogeneity of the treatment effect among the 3 trials was found for all-cause death (I(2)>50%), whereas in men, it was consistent across the 3 trials. In the Western trial (SYNTAX), female sex favored coronary artery bypass graft compared with percutaneous coronary intervention (hazard ratio (percutaneous coronary intervention) 2.213; 95% confidence interval, 1.242-3.943; P=0.007), whereas in the Asian women (PRECOMBAT and BEST), the treatment effect was neutral between both strategies. Sex interaction with treatment strategy was evident in the Western trial (Pinteraction =0.019) but not in the Asian trials (PRECOMBAT Pinteraction =0.469 and BEST Pinteraction =0.472; I(2)=58%). The present meta-analysis suggested the presence of the heterogeneous sex - treatment interaction across Asian and Western trials. Considering the ongoing globalization of our medical practice, the heterogeneity of the sex - treatment interaction needs to be well recognized and taken into account during the decision making of the treatment strategy.

Fermentation resulted in the production of hydrolysates that demonstrated excellent solubility (90.7%), good foaming capacity (36.7%) and emulsification activity (94.6 m(2)/g). Additionally, these protein hydrolysates exhibited remarkable bioactive properties for instance reducing power (2.53), protection from DPPH radical (70.5%) and angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibition (49.3%). The fermented protein hydrolysates were also found effective against various foodborne pathogens. The protein hydrolysates obtained by fermentation of ESM can be potentially incorporated in functional foods and nutraceuticals resulting in valorization of the ESM waste.",

      "document": "Granulomatous prostatitis: clinical and histomorphologic survey of the disease in a tertiary care hospital Granulomatous prostatitis is an uncommon entity that is diagnosed incidentally on histopathology and is broadly classified as nonspecific, specific, postsurgical (post-transurethral resection), or secondary to other rare systemic granulomatous diseases. Only very few studies are available in the literature that describe the clinical and histomorphological spectrum of the disease. A retrospective analysis of histopathological records of 1,181 prostatic specimens received in the pathology department was done over a period of 13 years (January 2003 to January 2016). All histologically proven cases of granulomatous prostatitis were retrieved, and relevant clinical data were collected from patients' records. Epstein and Hutchins classification was used to categorize these cases. Twenty-two cases of granulomatous prostatitis were identified, accounting for an incidence of 1.86%. Among these, nonspecific granulomatous prostatitis (n = 10) was the most common followed by tubercular prostatitis (n = 5), posttransurethral resection of the prostate (n = 3), allergic (n = 2), and xanthogranulomatous prostatitis (n = 2). The age range of these patients was between 41 and 75 years, with the majority of patients in their 7(th) decade. Serum prostate-specific antigen levels ranged between 0.88 ng/mL and 19.22 ng/mL. Hard and fixed nodules were observed on digital rectal examination in 14 cases. Transrectal ultrasound revealed hypoechoic shadows in five cases. Despite present-day advances in imaging modalities and serological investigations, it is virtually impossible to identify granulomatous prostatitis clinically. Histopathology remains the gold standard in diagnosing the disease. However, assigning an etiologic cause to the wide spectrum of granulomas in granulomatous prostatitis requires a pathologist's expertise and proper clinical correlation for appropriate patient management.",

      "document": "Fluorescence hyperspectral imaging (fHSI) using a spectrally resolved detector array The ability to resolve multiple fluorescent emissions from different biological targets in video rate applications, such as endoscopy and intraoperative imaging, has traditionally been limited by the use of filter-based imaging systems. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) facilitates the detection of both spatial and spectral information in a single data acquisition, however, instrumentation for HSI is typically complex, bulky and expensive. We sought to overcome these limitations using a novel robust and low cost HSI camera based on a spectrally resolved detector array (SRDA). We integrated this HSI camera into a wide-field reflectance-based imaging system operating in the near-infrared range to assess the suitability for in vivo imaging of exogenous fluorescent contrast agents. Using this fluorescence HSI (fHSI) system, we were able to accurately resolve the presence and concentration of at least 7 fluorescent dyes in solution. We also demonstrate high spectral unmixing precision, signal linearity with dye concentration and at depth in tissue mimicking phantoms, and delineate 4 fluorescent dyes in vivo. Our approach, including statistical background removal, could be directly generalised to broader spectral ranges, for example, to resolve tissue reflectance or autofluorescence and in future be tailored to video rate applications requiring snapshot HSI data acquisition.",

      "document": "Proline -rich antimicrobial peptides targeting protein synthesis Covering: up to 2017The innate immune system employs a broad array of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) to attack invading microorganisms. While most AMPs act by permeabilizing the bacterial membrane, specific subclasses of AMPs have been identified that pass through membranes and inhibit bacterial growth by targeting fundamental intracellular processes. One such subclass is the proline -rich antimicrobial peptides (PrAMPs) that bind to the ribosome and interfere with the process of protein synthesis. A diverse range of PrAMPs have been identified in insects, such as bees, wasps and beetles, and crustaceans, such as crabs, as well as in mammals, such as cows, sheep, goats and pigs. Mechanistically, the best-characterized PrAMPs are the insect oncocins, such as Onc112, and bovine bactenecins, such as Bac7. Biochemical and structural studies have revealed that these PrAMPs bind within the ribosomal exit tunnel with a reverse orientation compared to a nascent polypeptide chain. The PrAMPs allow initiation but prevent the transition into the elongation phase of translation. Insight into the interactions of PrAMPs with their ribosomal target provides the opportunity to further develop these peptides as novel antimicrobial agents.",

Guidelines for non-HIV PCP (NH-PCP) recommend adjunctive corticosteroids based on expert opinion. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis characterizing adjunctive corticosteroids for NH-PCP. We searched MEDLINE from 1966 through 2015. Data on clinical outcomes from NH-PCP were extracted with a standardized instrument. Heterogeneity was assessed with the I(2) index. Pooled odds ratios and 95% confidence interval were calculated using a fixed effects model. Our search yielded 5044 abstracts, 277 articles were chosen for full review, and 6 articles described outcomes in moderate to severe NH-PCP. Studies were limited by variable definitions, treatment selection bias, concomitant infections and small sample size. Individual studies reported shorter intensive care unit stay and duration of mechanical ventilation of patients given adjunctive corticosteroids. There was no association between corticosteroids and survival in NH-PCP (odds ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-1.15; P = 0.14). The literature does not support an association between adjunctive corticosteroids and survival from NH-PCP but data are limited and findings should not be considered conclusive. Further research with improved methodology is needed to better understand the role of adjunctive corticosteroids for NH-PCP.",

A total of 239 consecutive patients who underwent double valve replacement were enrolled. Valve pathology was rheumatic in 86.6% (207/239) and degenerative in 13.4% (32/239) of patients. Among these patients, 116 patients underwent concomitant tricuspid annuloplasty, and follow-up was completed for all 239 patients (mean = 7.3 ± 4.1, maximum = 15.9 years). We used propensity score matching to match 67 patients without tricuspid annuloplasty to the 114 patients who underwent annuloplasty. There was 1 in-hospital death and 9.7% (23/238) of patients experienced late cardiac -related mortality. Analysis of aortic valves indicated that the transprosthetic mean pressure gradient increased with time (13.4 ± 5.2 vs 15.4 ± 9.0 mm Hg, p = 0.002). Aortic transprosthetic mean pressure gradient increased more notably in woman and was associated with late TR (odds ratio 1.1, p = 0.010). In patients with mild TR, those who underwent tricuspid valve repair were less likely to experience a cardiac -related death within 10 years of surgery (hazards ratio 6.1, p = 0.036).",

      "document": "Cardiovascular Toxicity of Illicit Anabolic-Androgenic Steroid Use Millions of individuals have used illicit anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS), but the long-term cardiovascular associations of these drugs remain incompletely understood. Using a cross-sectional cohort design, we recruited 140 experienced male weightlifters 34 to 54 years of age, comprising 86 men reporting ≥2 years of cumulative lifetime AAS use and 54 nonusing men. Using transthoracic echocardiography and coronary computed tomography angiography, we assessed 3 primary outcome measures: left ventricular (LV) systolic function (left ventricular ejection fraction), LV diastolic function (early relaxation velocity), and coronary atherosclerosis (coronary artery plaque volume). Compared with nonusers, AAS users demonstrated relatively reduced LV systolic function (mean ± SD left ventricular ejection fraction = 52±11% versus 63±8%; P<0.001) and diastolic function (early relaxation velocity = 9.3±2.4 cm/second versus 11.1±2.0 cm/second; P<0.001).

In addition, AAS users demonstrated higher coronary artery plaque volume than nonusers (median [interquartile range] 3 [0, 174] mL(3) versus 0 [0, 69] mL(3); P=0.012). Lifetime AAS dose was strongly associated with coronary atherosclerotic burden (increase [95% confidence interval] in rank of plaque volume for each 10- year increase in cumulative duration of AAS use: 0.60 SD units [0.16-1.03 SD units]; P=0.008). Long-term AAS use appears to be associated with myocardial dysfunction and accelerated coronary atherosclerosis.

      "document": "G Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase 3 and Protein Kinase C Phosphorylate the Distal C-Terminal Tail of the Chemokine Receptor CXCR4 and Mediate Recruitment of β-Arrestin Phosphorylation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is a key event for cell signaling and regulation of receptor function. Previously, using tandem mass spectrometry, we identified two phosphorylation sites at the distal C-terminal tail of the chemokine receptor CXCR4, but were unable to determine which specific residues were phosphorylated. Here, we demonstrate that serines (Ser) 346 and/or 347 (Ser-346/7) of CXCR4 are phosphorylated upon stimulation with the agonist CXCL12 as well as a CXCR4 pepducin, ATI-2341. ATI-2341, a Gαiβγ heterotrimer - biased CXCR4 agonist, induced more robust phosphorylation of Ser-346/7 compared with CXCL12. Knockdown of G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) 2, GRK3, or GRK6 reduced CXCL12 - induced phosphorylation of Ser-346/7 with GRK3 knockdown having the strongest effect, while inhibition of the conventional protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, particularly PKCα, reduced phosphorylation of Ser-346/7 induced by either CXCL12 or ATI-2341. The loss of GRK3 - or PKC -mediated phosphorylation of Ser-346/7 impaired the recruitment of β-arrestin to CXCR4. We also found that a pseudo - substrate peptide inhibitor for PKCζ effectively inhibited CXCR4 phosphorylation and signaling, most likely by functioning as a nonspecific CXCR4 antagonist. Together, these studies demonstrate the role Ser-346 / 7 plays in arrestin recruitment and initiation of receptor desensitization and provide insight into the dysregulation of CXCR4 observed in patients with various forms of WHIM syndrome.",

Drug loaded magnetic nanoparticles by using external magnetic field could selectively accumulate the drug at the target site and thereby reduce the doses required to achieve therapeutic concentration which may otherwise produce serious side effects on healthy cells. In the present study the artemisinin magnetic nanoparticles were successfully formulated using chitosan by ionic-gelation method. The developed magnetic nanoparticles of artemisinin were smooth and spherical in nature and their size was in the range of 349-445nm. The polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential of the formulated nanoparticles were in the range of 0.373-0.908 and -9.34 to -33.3 respectively. They showed 55% to 62.5% of drug encapsulation efficiency and 20% to 25% drug loading capacity. Around 62% to 78% of artemisinin was released from the artemisinin magnetic nanoparticles over the period of 48h. On application of physiologically acceptable external magnetic field, FITC conjugated artemisinin magnetic nanoparticles showed an enhanced accumulation of nanoparticles in the 4T1 breast tumour tissues of BALB/c mice model.",

      "document": "Engagement of cellular prion protein with the co-chaperone Hsp70 / 90 organizing protein regulates the proliferation of glioblastoma stem-like cells Glioblastoma (GBM), a highly aggressive brain tumor, contains a subpopulation of glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) that play roles in tumor maintenance, invasion, and therapeutic resistance. GSCs are therefore a promising target for GBM treatment. Our group identified the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) and its partner, the co-chaperone Hsp70 / 90 organizing protein (HOP), as potential target candidates due to their role in GBM tumorigenesis and in neural stem cell maintenance. GSCs expressing different levels of PrP(C) were cultured as neurospheres with growth factors, and characterized with stem cells markers and adhesion molecules markers through immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. We than evaluated GSC self-renewal and proliferation by clonal density assays and BrdU incorporation, respectively, in front of recombinant HOP treatment, combined or not with a HOP peptide which mimics the PrP(C) binding site. Stable silencing of HOP was also performed in parental and/or PrP(C) -depleted cell populations, and proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo were evaluated. Migration assays were performed on laminin-1 pre-coated glass. We observed that, when GBM cells are cultured as neurospheres, they express specific stemness markers such as CD133, CD15, Oct4, and SOX2; PrP(C) is upregulated compared to monolayer culture and co-localizes with CD133. PrP(C) silencing downregulates the expression of molecules associated with cancer stem cells, upregulates markers of cell differentiation and affects GSC self-renewal, pointing to a pivotal role for PrP(C) in the maintenance of GSCs. Exogenous HOP treatment increases proliferation and self-renewal of GSCs in a PrP(C) -dependent manner while HOP knockdown disturbs the proliferation process. In vivo, PrP(C) and/or HOP knockdown potently inhibits the growth of subcutaneously implanted glioblastoma cells. In addition, disruption of the PrP(C) - HOP complex by a HOP peptide, which mimics the PrP(C) binding site, affects GSC self-renewal and proliferation indicating that the HOP - PrP(C) complex is required for GSC stemness. Furthermore, PrP(C) -depleted GSCs downregulate cell adhesion-related proteins and impair cell migration indicating a putative role for PrP(C) in the cell surface stability of cell adhesion molecules and GBM cell invasiveness, respectively. In conclusion, our results show that the modulation of HOP - PrP(C) engagement or the decrease of PrP(C) and HOP expression may represent a potential therapeutic intervention in GBM, regulating glioblastoma stem-like cell self-renewal, proliferation, and migration.",

Here we report that feedback activation of mTOR in the PI-3 kinase pathway by two p70 S6 kinase (S6K1) inhibitors (PF-4708671 and A77 1726, the active metabolite of an immunosuppressive drug leflunomide) or by S6K1 knockdown did not suppress but rather induced autophagy. Suppression of S6K1 activity led to the phosphorylation and activation of AMPK, which then phosphorylated ULK1 at S555. While mTOR feedback activation led to increased phosphorylation of ULK1 at S757, this modification did not the disrupt ULK1 - AMPK interaction nor dampen ULK1 S555 phosphorylation and the induction of autophagy. In addition, inhibition of S6K1 activity led to JNK activation, which also contributed to autophagy. 5Z-7-oxozeaenol, a specific inhibitor of TAK1, or TAK1 siRNA blocked A77 1726 -induced activation of AMPK and JNK, and LC3 lipidation.

In a randomized trial, healthy nulliparous in labor were randomized into one of three intravenous fluid regimens: group 1, the reference group, lactated Ringer's solution infused at a rate of 125 mL/h; group 2, lactated Ringer's solution infused at a rate of 250 mL/h; group 3, 0.9% saline solution boosted with 5% glucose, infused at a rate of 125 mL/h. The primary outcome was labor length from enrollment until delivery. Between December 2010 and July 2015, 300 women were randomized to one of the three groups. Demographic and baseline obstetric characteristics were comparable between the groups. There was no significant difference in the time from enrollment to delivery (p = 0.62). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in second stage duration (p = 0.73), mode of delivery (p = 0.21), cord artery pH and glucose level between the groups. Increasing the intravenous volume of lactated Ringer's solution or substituting to fluid containing 5% glucose solution does not affect labor length.

      "document": "Interplay between adsorbed peptide structure, trapped water, and surface hydrophobicity Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations were used to study the influence of interfacial water on the orientation and conformation of a facewise amphipathic α-helical peptide adsorbed to hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrates. Water behavior beneath the peptide adsorbed to a hydrophilic surface was observed to vary with the height of the peptide above the surface. In general, the orientation of water close to the peptide (with the oxygen atom pointing up toward the peptide) was complementary to that observed near the hydrophilic surface in the absence of peptide. That is, no change in orientation of water trapped between the peptide and a hydrophilic surface is required as the peptide approaches the surface. The adsorption of the peptide to the hydrophilic surface was observed to be mediated by a layer of ordered water. Water was found to be largely excluded on adsorption to the hydrophobic surface. However, the small amount of water present was observed to be highly ordered. At the closest point of contact to the hydrophobic surface, the peptide was observed to make direct contact. These findings shed light on the fundamental driving forces of peptide adsorption to hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces in aqueous environments.",

      "document": "Mucosal IgM Antibody with d-Mannose Affinity in Fugu Takifugu rubripes Is Utilized by a Monogenean Parasite Heterobothrium okamotoi for Host Recognition How parasites recognize their definitive hosts is a mystery; however, parasitism is reportedly initiated by recognition of certain molecules on host surfaces. Fish ectoparasites make initial contact with their hosts at body surfaces, such as skin and gills, which are covered with mucosa that are similar to those of mammalian guts. Fish are among the most primitive vertebrates with immune systems that are equivalent to those in mammals, and they produce and secrete IgM into mucus. In this study, we showed that the monogenean parasite Heterobothrium okamotoi utilizes IgM to recognize its host, fugu Takifugu rubripes Oncomiracidia are infective larvae of H. okamotoi that shed their cilia and metamorphose into juveniles when exposed to purified d-mannose - binding fractions from fugu mucus. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, proteins contained in the fraction were identified as d-mannose -specific IgM with two d-mannose -binding lectins. However, although deciliation was significantly induced by IgM and was inhibited by d-mannose or a specific Ab against fugu IgM, other lectins had no effect, and IgM without d-mannose affinity induced deciliation to a limited degree. Subsequent immunofluorescent staining experiments showed that fugu d-mannose -specific IgM binds ciliated epidermal cells of oncomiracidium. These observations suggest that deciliation is triggered by binding of fugu IgM to cell surface Ags via Ag binding sites. Moreover, concentrations of d-mannose - binding IgM in gill mucus were sufficient to induce deciliation in vitro, indicating that H. okamotoi parasites initially use host Abs to colonize host gills.",

The medical records of 47 consecutive patients who underwent simultaneous bilateral small-incision cataract surgery between January 2010 and December 2015 in outreach surgical camps in rural Cameroon were reviewed. The measures included postoperative visual outcomes and intraoperative and postoperative complications. Data from 94 eyes of 47 participants (30 men, 17 women; mean age: 60.93 ± 13.58 years, range: 45-80 years) were included in this study. The presented best visual acuity (VA) was less than 3/60 in 100% of the eyes. At the 4- week follow-up, 84.04% of the eyes showed increased VA of 1 line or more (P = .001). Of these, 71 (75.53%) achieved good VA (greater than 6/18). Intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred in 19 (20.21%) eyes. The most serious intraoperative complication was a posterior capsule rupture and vitreous loss (2 patients, 2 eyes). The postoperative complications included a transient elevation in the intraocular pressure (6 eyes), chronic corneal oedema (5 eyes), iris capture (3 eyes), lens decentration (2 eyes), and hyphema (1 eye). No cases of postoperative endophthalmitis were recorded. Under the strict observation of endophthalmitis prophylaxis, SBCS is an option to reduce the cataract blindness backlog in rural areas of developing countries.",

Oncolytic myxoma virus (MYXV) exhibits potent anti-cancer efficacy against human cancers like multiple myeloma (MM) and can arm transplant -derived T cells to become more effective cancer killers in vitro and in an immunodeficient xenotransplant murine model. Here, we tested ex vivo MYXV virotherapy against residual murine MM in immunocompetent mice using an allogeneic mouse-mouse model. In contrast to all human MM cell lines previously tested, the murine MM cell line tested here was highly resistant to direct MYXV infection and oncolysis in vitro. Despite this in vitro resistance, we found that ex vivo MYXV -armed allogeneic bone marrow (BM) transplantation dramatically ablated pre-seeded residual MM in vivo. Unexpectedly, we show that both neutrophils and activated T cells from the donor function as virus-armed carrier cells, and MYXV -preloaded cells enhanced MM killing. Our results demonstrate a novel therapeutic paradigm for residual cancer, in which multiple classes of allotransplant leukocytes can be armed by MYXV ex vivo to enhance the graft-versus-tumor effects.",

      "document": "A Novel BRCA1-Associated Protein-1 Isoform Affects Response of Mesothelioma Cells to Drugs Impairing BRCA1 -Mediated DNA Repair BRCA1 associated protein1 (BAP1) is a tumor suppressor involved in multiple cellular processes such as transcriptional regulation, chromatin modification by deubiquitinating histone 2A, and DNA repair. BAP1 mutations are frequent in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Our aim was to functionally characterize a newly identified isoform of BAP1 and investigate the effects of its expression on drug sensitivity in MPM. Expression of BAP1 isoforms was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in MPM and normal mesothelium cell lines and tumor and nontumor samples. Histone H2A ubiquitination levels were analyzed by Western blot after acidic extraction of core histones. Subcellular localization of BAP1 isoforms was examined by immunofluorescence. MPM cell survival in response to poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and dual phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)- mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors was analyzed by in vitro assays. We have identified a novel alternative splice isoform of BAP1 (BAP1Δ) that misses part of the catalytic domain. Cells transfected with BAP1Δ showed reduced deubiquitinating activity compared with full-length BAP1. The expression of BAP1Δ transcript is more abundant in nontumor than in tumor samples. MPM cell lines expressing more than 20% of BAP1Δ are more sensitive to olaparib (a PARP1 inhibitor) cytotoxicity, and this sensitivity is enhanced when olaparib treatment is combined with GDC0980 (a dual PI3K - mTOR inhibitor), which induces downregulation of BRCA1. These observations suggest that BAP1Δ does regulate DNA damage response and influences drug sensitivity. It might therefore be relevant to investigate whether patients with high expression of BAP1Δ may be responsive to PARP / PI3K - mTOR inhibitors.",

Twelve- week -old male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups (n = 5 each): a normal occlusion (C) group, an occlusal hypofunction (H) group, and an occlusal hypofunction group subjected to LIPUS (HL) treatment. Hypofunctional occlusion of the maxillary first molar (M1) of the H and HL groups was induced by the bite-raising technique. Only the HL group was irradiated with LIPUS for 5 days. The IRAB and PDL of M1 were examined by microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) analysis. To quantify mRNA expression of cytokines involved in PDL proliferation and development, real-time reverse transcription quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed for twist family bHLH transcription factor 1 (Twist1), periostin, and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in the PDL samples. Micro-CT analysis showed that the PDL volume was decreased in the H group compared with that of the C and HL groups. Both bone volume per tissue volume (BV / TV) of IRAB was decreased in the H group compared with that in the C group. LIPUS exposure restored BV / TV in the IRAB of the HL group. qRT-PCR analysis showed that Twist1, periostin, and CTGF mRNA levels were decreased in the H group and increased in the HL group. LIPUS exposure reduced the atrophic changes of alveolar bone by inducing the upregulation of periostin and CTGF expression to promote PDL healing after induction of occlusal hypofunction.",

      "document": "A role for the locus coeruleus in the analgesic efficacy of N-acetylaspartylglutamate peptidase (GCPII) inhibitors ZJ43 and 2-PMPA N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) is the third most prevalent and widely distributed neurotransmitter in the mammalian nervous system. NAAG activates a group II metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR3) and is inactivated by an extracellular enzyme, glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) in vivo. Inhibitors of this enzyme are analgesic in animal models of inflammatory, neuropathic and bone cancer pain. NAAG and GCPII are present in the locus coeruleus, a center for the descending noradrenergic inhibitory pain system. In the formalin footpad model, systemic treatment with GCPII inhibitors reduces both phases of the inflammatory pain response and increases release of spinal noradrenaline. This analgesic efficacy is blocked by systemic injection of a group II mGluR antagonist, by intrathecal (spinal) injection of an alpha 2 adrenergic receptor antagonist and by microinjection of an α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist directly into the contralateral locus coeruleus. Footpad inflammation increases release of glutamate in the contralateral locus coeruleu s and systemic treatment with a GCPII inhibitor blocks this increase. Direct injection of GCPII inhibitors into the contralateral or ipsilatera l locus coeruleus reduces both phases of the inflammatory pain response in a dose-dependent manner and the contralateral effect also is blocked by intrathecal injection of an alpha 2 adrenergic receptor antagonist. These data support the hypothesis that the analgesic efficacy of systemically administered GCPII inhibitors is mediated, at least in part, by the contralatera l locus coeruleus via group II mGluR, AMPA and alpha 2 adrenergic receptors.",

The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of quantitatively assessing muscular mechanical properties intraoperatively using ultrasound elastography (shear wave elastography [SWE]) during extensor indicis proprius (EIP) transfer. We report two cases of EIP transfer for post-traumatic rupture of the extensor pollicis longus muscle. Ultrasound acquisitions measured the elasticity modulus of the EIP muscle at different stages: rest, active extension, active extension against resistance, EIP section, distal passive traction of the tendon, after tendon transfer at rest and then during active extension. A preliminary analysis was conducted of the distribution of values for this modulus at the various transfer steps. Different shear wave velocity and elasticity modulus values were observed at the various transfer steps. The tension applied during the transfer seemed close to the resting tension if a traditional protocol were followed. The elasticity modulus varied by a factor of 37 between the active extension against resistance step (565.1 kPa) and after the tendon section (15.3 kPa). The elasticity modulus values were distributed in the same way for each patient. The therapeutic benefit of SWE elastography was studied for the first time in tendon transfers. Quantitative data on the elasticity modulus during this test may make it an effective means of improving intraoperative adjustments.",

      "document": "Young people, mental health practitioners and researchers co-produce a Transition Preparation Programme to improve outcomes and experience for young people leaving Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) In the UK young people attending child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) are required to move on, either through discharge or referral to an adult service, at age 17/18, a period of increased risk for onset of mental health problems and other complex psychosocial and physical changes. CAMHS transitions are often poorly managed with negative outcomes for young people. Better preparation may improve outcomes and experience. This study aimed to co-produce, with young people who had transitioned or were facing transition from CAMHS, a CAMHS Transition Preparation Programme (TPP), deliverable in routine NHS settings. Eighteen young people, aged 17-22, from three UK National Health Service (NHS) mental health foundation trusts participated in creative, participatory research workshops. Seven parents completed short questionnaires. Thirty clinical staff from two trusts took part in workshops to ensure deliverability of young people's ideas. Young people were offered co-research opportunities. Most young people felt anxious, fearful and uncertain on leaving CAMHS and perceived mental health services as uncaring. Participants outlined transition procedures and drafted a range of preparation activities, centred around dedicated Transition Peer Support and a transition booklet, which should be offered to all CAMHS leavers, irrespective of discharge or transfer to an adult service. Preparation should aim to build confidence to help young people take responsibility for themselves and flourish in the adult world: coping or getting through it was not enough. Some clinicians also felt anxious at transition and recognised the potential impact on young people of poor communication and lack of understanding between services. Parents would appreciate help to support their offspring during the transition period. Clinicians cited lack of funding and inflexible NHS procedures and policies as potential barriers to the implementation of young people's ideas. Nine young people took up co-research opportunities. Mental health services underestimate the anxiety of CAMHS leavers. Young people have clear ideas about the preparation they require to leave CAMHS with the confidence to take responsibility for their own health care. Close collaboration of NHS staff and researchers facilitates the implementation of research findings.",

Since 2009, the Swedish Knee Arthroplasty Register (SKAR) has been collecting information on the prophylactic antibiotic regime used at every individual operation. In Sweden, when there is allergy to penicillin, clindamycin has been the recommended alternative. We examined whether there were differences in the rate of revision due to infection depending on which antibiotic was used as systemic prophylaxis. Patients and methods - Patients who had a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) performed due to osteoarthritis (OA) during the years 2009-2015 were included in the study. Information on which antibiotic was used was available for 80,018 operations (55,530 patients). Survival statistics were used to calculate the rate of revision due to infection until the end of 2015, comparing the group of patients who received cloxacillin with those who received clindamycin as systemic prophylaxis. Results - Cloxacillin was used in 90% of the cases, clindamycin in 7%, and cephalosporins in 2%. The risk of being revised due to infection was higher when clindamycin was used than when cloxacillin was used (RR =1.5, 95% CI: 1.2-2.0; p = 0.001). There was no significant difference in the revision rate for other causes (p = 0.2). Interpretation - We advise that patients reporting allergic reaction to penicillin should have their allergic history explored. In the absence of a clear history of type-I allergic reaction (e.g. urticaria, anaphylaxis, or bronchospasm), we suggest the use of a third-generation cephalosporin instead of clindamycin as perioperative prophylaxis when undergoing a TKR. No recommendation can be given regarding patients with type-1 allergy.",

We focused our attention on the rate of the first PSA increase and on the influence of prostatic inflammation. From 2011 to 2016, 365 men with a previous negative prostate biopsy and persistent elevated PSA levels received dutasteride treatment. The population was followed for a range of 12-48 months. One hundred twelve cases with a confirmed PSA increase >0.5 ng/ml over the nadir value during the follow-up were included in Group A and underwent a new prostate biopsy. In Group A, the PSA increase was associated with PC at the re-biopsy in 66% of cases. The percentage of PSA reduction after 6 months of treatment was not a significant indicator of the risk for PC. The distribution of inflammatory infiltrates significantly (p<00.01) varied from positive to negative prostate biopsies. The relative risk for PC at biopsy significantly increase d according to PSA level during dutasteride. Treatment with dutasteride can help to analyze PSA kinetic. A persistent prostatic inflammation is a factor able to reduce the performance of PSA kinetic during dutasteride treatment.",

The database search employed the following key words: \" topical fluorides \" AND \" children \" AND \" clinical trials \"; \" topical fluorides \" OR \" silver diamine fluoride \" AND \" randomized controlled trial \"; \" silver diamine fluoride \" AND \" children \" OR \" primary dentition \" AND \" tooth decay \"; \" silver diamine fluoride \" OR \" sodium fluoride varnish \" AND \" early childhood caries \"; and \" silver diamine fluoride \" AND \" children \". Inclusion criteria were articles published in English, from 2005 to January 2016, on clinical studies using SDF as a treatment intervention to evaluate caries arrest in children with primary dentition and/or permanent first molars. Database searches provided 821 eligible publications, of which 33 met the inclusion criteria. After the abstracts were prescreened, 25 articles were dismissed based on exclusion criteria. The remaining 8 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 7 publications were included in the SR. These included 1 study assessing the effectiveness of SDF at different concentrations; 3 studies comparing SDF with other interventions; 2 investigations comparing SDF at different application frequencies and with other interventions; and 1 study comparing semiannual SDF applications versus a control group. The literature indicates that SDF is a preventive treatment for dental caries in community settings. At concentrations of 30% and 38%, SDF shows potential as an alternative treatment for caries arrest in the primary dentition and permanent first molars. To establish guidelines, more studies are needed to fully assess the effectiveness of SDF and to determine the appropriate application frequency.",

      "document": "Sleep Loss Promotes Astrocytic Phagocytosis and Microglial Activation in Mouse Cerebral Cortex We previously found that Mertk and its ligand Gas6, astrocytic genes involved in phagocytosis, are upregulated after acute sleep deprivation. These results suggested that astrocytes may engage in phagocytic activity during extended wake, but direct evidence was lacking. Studies in humans and rodents also found that sleep loss increases peripheral markers of inflammation, but whether these changes are associated with neuroinflammation and/or activation of microglia, the brain's resident innate immune cells, was unknown. Here we used serial block-face scanning electron microscopy to obtain 3D volume measurements of synapses and surrounding astrocytic processes in mouse frontal cortex after 6-8 h of sleep, spontaneous wake, or sleep deprivation (SD) and after chronic (∼5 d) sleep restriction (CSR). Astrocytic phagocytosis, mainly of presynaptic components of large synapses, increased after both acute and chronic sleep loss relative to sleep and wake. MERTK expression and lipid peroxidation in synaptoneurosomes also increased to a similar extent after short and long sleep loss, suggesting that astrocytic phagocytosis may represent the brain's response to the increase in synaptic activity associated with prolonged wake, clearing worn components of heavily used synapses. Using confocal microscopy, we then found that CSR but not SD mice show morphological signs of microglial activation and enhanced microglial phagocytosis of synaptic elements, without obvious signs of neuroinflammation in the CSF. Because low - level sustained microglia activation can lead to abnormal responses to a secondary insult, these results suggest that chronic sleep loss, through microglia priming, may predispose the brain to further damage .SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We find that astrocytic phagocytosis of synaptic elements, mostly of presynaptic origin and in large synapses, is upregulated already after a few hours of sleep deprivation and shows a further significant increase after prolonged and severe sleep loss, suggesting that it may promote the housekeeping of heavily used and strong synapses in response to the increased neuronal activity of extended wake. By contrast, chronic sleep restriction but not acute sleep loss activates microglia, promotes their phagocytic activity, and does so in the absence of overt signs of neuroinflammation, suggesting that like many other stressors, extended sleep disruption may lead to a state of sustained microglia activation, perhaps increasing the brain's susceptibility to other forms of damage.",

Among the MutS proteins most extensively studied in vitro are those derived from Thermus thermophilus, Thermus aquaticus and Escherichia coli. Here, we present the first report on the in vitro examination of DNA mismatch binding activity of MutS protein from Deinococcus radiodurans and confront this with the properties of those from E. coli and T. thermophilus. The analyses which included mobility gel-shift assay, colorimetric and qPCR estimation of MutS -bound DNA clearly showed that D. radiodurans MutS exhibited much higher affinity towards mismatched DNA in vitro than its counterparts from E. coli and T. thermophilus. In addition, D. radiodurans MutS displayed a significantly higher specificity of DNA mismatch binding than the two other orthologues. The specificity expressed as the ratio of mismatched to fully complementary DNA bound reached over 4 and 20-fold higher values for D. radiodurans than for T. thermophilus and E. coli MutS, respectively. The results demonstrate mainly the biotechnological potential of D. radiodurans MutS but the in vitro characteristics of the MutS orthologues could reflect substantial differences in DNA mismatch binding activities existing in vivo.",

This study aims to determine if the use of psychotropic medication, in a cohort of women with severe mental illness, increases rates of special care nursery admission and reports differences between antidepressant and antipsychotic medication use either alone or in combination. A retrospective database analysis from a cohort with severe mental illness in pregnancy identified 268 pregnant women who were grouped according to medication type. Demographic, obstetric and neonatal variables were analysed using t-tests, χ(2), analysis of variance and logistic regression analysis for special care nursery admission. The medication groups consisted of: women taking no psychotropic medications (n = 67); those taking antipsychotics (n = 87); those taking antidepressants (n = 55); those taking and a combination of antidepressants/antipsychotics (n = 59). Rates of special care nursery admission in women who took psychotropic medication (41.3%) were elevated compared to those who did not (26.9%) (P = 0.035), and were significantly raised when compared to the general population (P < 0.000). No significant difference occurred between the medication groups. A significant adjusted odds ratio of 2.79 (95% CI 1.286-6.049) was found for special care nursery and psychiatric admission during pregnancy but not for psychotropic medication. Rates of special care nursery admission are elevated in neonates of women with severe mental illness taking psychotropic medication, but were not different for monotherapy or polytherapy when prescribing antidepressants or antipsychotic medication. Additional vulnerability occurs in the neonates of women with a mental illness and paediatric presence at delivery is recommended.",

      "document": "The WW domain of the scaffolding protein IQGAP1 is neither necessary nor sufficient for binding to the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2 Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) scaffold proteins, such as IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1), are promising targets for novel therapies against cancer and other diseases. Such approaches require accurate information about which domains on the scaffold protein bind to the kinases in the MAPK cascade. Results from previous studies have suggested that the WW domain of IQGAP1 binds to the cancer -associated MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2, and that this domain might thus offer a new tool to selectively inhibit MAPK activation in cancer cells. The goal of this work was therefore to critically evaluate which IQGAP1 domains bind to ERK1 / 2. Here, using quantitative in vitro binding assays, we show that the IQ domain of IQGAP1 is both necessary and sufficient for binding to ERK1 and ERK2, as well as to the MAPK kinases MEK1 and MEK2. Furthermore, we show that the WW domain is not required for ERK - IQGAP1 binding, and contributes little or no binding energy to this interaction, challenging previous models of how WW-based peptides might inhibit tumorigenesis. Finally, we show that the ERK2 - IQGAP1 interaction does not require ERK2 phosphorylation or catalytic activity and does not involve known docking recruitment sites on ERK2, and we obtain an estimate of the dissociation constant (Kd) for this interaction of 8 μm These results prompt a re-evaluation of published findings and a refined model of IQGAP scaffolding.",

      "document": "Mapping mitochondrial heteroplasmy in a Leydig tumor by laser capture micro-dissection and cycling temperature capillary electrophoresis The growth of tumor cells is accompanied by mutations in nuclear and mitochondrial genomes creating marked genetic heterogeneity. Tumors also contain non-tumor cells of various origins. An observed somatic mitochondrial mutation would have occurred in a founding cell and spread through cell division. Micro-anatomical dissection of a tumor coupled with assays for mitochondrial point mutations permits new insights into this growth process. More generally, the ability to detect and trace, at a histological level, somatic mitochondrial mutations in human tissues and tumors, makes these mutations into markers for lineage tracing. A tumor was first sampled by a large punch biopsy and scanned for any significant degree of heteroplasmy in a set of sequences containing known mutational hotspots of the mitochondrial genome. A heteroplasmic tumor was sliced at a 12 μm thickness and placed on membranes. Laser capture micro-dissection was used to take 25000 μm(2) subsamples or spots. After DNA amplification, cycling temperature capillary electrophoresis (CTCE) was used on the laser captured samples to quantify mitochondrial mutant fractions. Of six testicular tumors studied, one, a Leydig tumor, was discovered to carry a detectable degree of heteroplasmy for two separate point mutations: a C → T mutation at bp 64 and a T → C mutation found at bp 152. From this tumor, 381 spots were sampled with laser capture micro-dissection. The ordered distribution of spots exhibited a wide range of fractions of the mutant sequences from 0 to 100% mutant copies. The two mutations co-distributed in the growing tumor indicating they were present on the same genome copies in the founding cell. Laser capture micro-dissection of sliced tumor samples coupled with CTCE -based point mutation assays provides an effective and practical means to obtain maps of mitochondrial mutational heteroplasmy within human tumors.",

      "document": "Chronic Enzyme Replacement to the Brain of a Late Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Mouse Has Differential Effects on Phenotypes of Disease Late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (LINCL) is a fatal inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by loss of lysosomal protease tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1). We have investigated the effects of chronic intrathecal (IT) administration using enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) to the brain of an LINCL mouse model, in which locomotor function declines dramatically prior to early death. Median lifespan was significantly extended from 126 days to >259 days when chronic IT treatment was initiated before the onset of disease. While treated animals lived longer and showed little sign of locomotor dysfunction as measured by stride length, some or all (depending on regimen) still died prematurely. One explanation is that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-mediated delivery may not deliver TPP1 to all brain regions. Morphological studies support this, showing delivery of TPP1 to ventral, but not deeper and dorsal regions. When IT treatment is initiated in severely affected LINCL mice, lifespan was extended modestly in most but dramatically extended in approximately one-third of the cohort. Treatment improved locomotor function in these severely compromised animals after it had declined to the point at which animals normally die. This indicates that some pathology in LINCL is reversible and does not simply reflect neuronal death.",

Here, we determined the effects of dietary grape seed proanthocyanidins (GSPs) on the development and activity of UVB - induced Treg cells. C3H/HeN mice fed a GSPs (0.5%, w/w)- supplemented or control diet were exposed to UVB (150 mJ/cm2) radiation, sensitized to 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) and sacrificed 5 days later. FACS analysis indicated that dietary GSPs decrease the numbers of UVB - induced Treg cells. ELISA analysis of cultured sorted Treg cells indicated that secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines (interleukin-10, TGF-β) was significantly lower in Treg cells from GSPs - fed mice. Dietary GSPs also enhanced the ability of Treg cells from wild-type mice to stimulate production of IFNγ by T cells. These effects of dietary GSPs on Treg cell function were not found in XPA - deficient mice, which are incapable of repairing UVB - induced DNA damage. Adoptive transfer experiments revealed that naïve recipients that received Treg cells from GSPs - fed UVB - irradiated wild-type donors that had been sensitized to DNFB exhibited a significantly higher contact hypersensitivity (CHS) response to DNFB than mice that received Treg cells from UVB - exposed mice fed the control diet. There was no significant difference in the CHS response between mice that received Treg cells from UVB - irradiated XPA - deficient donors fed GSPs or the control diet. Furthermore, dietary GSPs significantly inhibited UVB - induced skin tumor development in wild-type mice but not in XPA - deficient mice. These results suggest that GSPs inactivate Treg cells by promoting DNA repair in dendritic cells in UVB - exposed skin.",

      "document": "Grapevine Subtilase Family: Update on New Sequences and Nomenclature Proposal In grapevine, serine peptidases from the subtilase family were recently associated to Plasmopara viticola resistance. This family in grapevine, first characterized in 2014, was re-analyzed last year and 82 subtilase genes were identified. However, in November of 2016, the National Center for Biotechnology Information database (NCBI) made a new public release of the grapevine genome annotation based on new sequencing data and better prediction algorithms. As a consequence, some gene annotations and lengths changed. Here we present an update to the grapevine subtilase gene family sequences (SBT), namely sequence identifiers, bioinformatic predictions and recommend a nomenclature for the grapevine SBT genes. Our results show that grapevine subtilase gene family is now constituted by 87 subtilase genes encoding for 109 subtilase proteins and, despite the reported alterations, expression data on subtilases associated to grapevine resistance to P. viticola pathosystem did not suffer any alteration.",

The stone-free status was defined as the absence of any stones or asymptomatic status, or the presence of clinically insignificant residual fragments <4 mm, and was assessed by plain kidney, ureter, and bladder X-ray. The operative time, stone-free rates (SFRs), serum creatinine (SCr), and complications were recorded. During the operation, there was no bleeding, ureteral perforation, avulsion, and rupture. Postoperative hematuria was observed in 2 patients. SCr increased significantly on the first day after the procedure compared with the preoperative SCr, but after 4 weeks, the renal function significantly improved (p < 0.05). The SFR was 71.6% (63/88) on the first day after the first surgical procedure; it then increased to 86.4% (76/88) in the fourth week, and rose to 97.4% (76/78) after the second operation. The results demonstrated that FURS in combination with holmium laser lithotripsy represented a favorable less-invasive alternative with high SFR and acceptable complication rates in the treatment of bilateral upper urinary tract calculi.",

      "document": "Multi-hospital occurrence of pan-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae ST147 with an ISEcp1 -directed blaOXA-181 insertion into the mgrB gene in the United Arab Emirates The emergence of pan-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strains is an increasing concern. In the current study we describe a cluster of 9 pan-resistant K. pneumoniae ST147 isolates encountered in 4 patients over nearly one year in 3 hospitals of the United Arab Emirates. The isolates exhibited highly similar genotypes. All produced chromosomally encoded OXA-181 and the majority also produced the NDM-5 carbapenemase. Similarly to the previously described single isolate from the UAE, MS6671, the mgrB was disrupted by a functional, ISEcp1 -driven blaOXA-181 insertion causing resistance to carbapenems. The mutation was successfully complemented with an intact mgrB gene indicating that it was responsible for colistin resistance. blaNDM-5 was located within a resistance island of an approximately 100 kb IncFII plasmid carrying ermB, mph(A), blaTEM-1B, rmtB, blaNDM-5, sul1, aadA2 and dfrA12 resistance genes. Sequencing this plasmid (pABC143-NDM) revealed that its backbone was nearly identical to that of plasmid pMS6671E from which several resistance genes, including blaNDM-5, had been deleted. More extensive similarities of the backbone and the resistance island were found between pABC143C-NDM and the blaNDM-5 carrying IncFII plasmids of two K. pneumoniae ST147 isolates from South Korea, one of which was colistin resistant, and both also produced OXA-181. Notably one of these strains was isolated from a patient transferred from the UAE. Our data show that this pan-resistant clone has an alarming capacity to maintain itself over an extended period of time, and even likely to be transmitted internationally.",

Previous results have shown that methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) can help Paulownia seedlings recover from the symptoms of witches' broom and reinstate a healthy morphology. In this study, a transcriptomic-assisted proteomic technique was used to analyze the protein changes in phytoplasma - infected Paulownia tomentosa seedlings, phytoplasma - infected seedlings treated with 20 and 60 mg·L(-1) MMS, and healthy seedlings.

      "document": "Aridity promotes bet hedging via delayed hatching: a case study with two temporary pond crustaceans along a latitudinal gradient Climate change does affect not only average rainfall and temperature but also their variation, which can reduce the predictability of suitable conditions for growth and reproduction. This situation is problematic for inhabitants of temporary waters whose reproductive success depends on rainfall and evaporation that determine the length of the aquatic phase. For organisms with long-lived dormant life stages, bet hedging models suggest that a fraction of these should stay dormant during each growing season to buffer against the probability of total reproductive failure in variable environments. Thus far, however, little empirical evidence supports this prediction in aquatic organisms. We study geographic variation in delayed hatching of dormant eggs in natural populations of two crustaceans, Branchinella longirostris and Paralimnadia badia, that occur in temporary rock pools along a 725 km latitudinal aridity gradient in Western Australia. Consistent with bet hedging theory, populations of both species were characterised by delayed hatching under common garden conditions and hatching fractions decreased towards the drier end of the gradient where the probability of reproductive success was shown to be lower. This decrease was most pronounced in the species with the longer maturation time, presumably because it is more sensitive to the higher prevalence of short inundations. Overall, these findings illustrate that regional variation in climate can be reflected in differential investment in bet hedging and hints at a higher importance of delayed hatching to persist when the climate becomes harsher. Such strategies could become exceedingly relevant as determinants of vulnerability under climate change.",

However HCT can be associated with significant complications including organ toxicity, graft -versus-host disease and relapse. One other serious but rare complication is the transmission of hematologic and non- hematologic diseases from the donor to the recipient. With older donors, the risk of an abnormality in the donor may be higher. Here we describe the transmission of an inversion 3 constitutional cytogenetic abnormality from an unrelated donor to a recipient and review the clinical implications of the discovery of donor - derived constitutional cytogenetic abnormalities.",

Consecutive patients with mesenteric embolization after endovascular aorto-iliac intervention between 2011 and 2015 (case - group, n = 9) were investigated and compared with age, gender and procedure - matched random controls (n = 36). Compared to the control group, a higher proportion of patients with mesenteric embolization were current smokers (89% vs. 53%; P = 0.048) and had renal insufficiency at admission (44% vs. 11%; P = 0.019). In patients treated for aorto-iliac occlusive disease, aortic irregularity (shagginess) was more severe (P = 0.015), visceral thrombus volume was larger (P = 0.004) and operation - time was longer (P = 0.009) among the case - group. However, no difference s were found between cases with mesenteric embolization caused by endovascular aortic aneurysm repair versus controls. Myoglobin, arterial blood lactate, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and pancreatic amylase levels were elevated in 100%, 67%, 89%, 89%, 89% and 56% of patients with mesenteric embolization, respectively. Overall in-hospital mortality among cases was 33% (3/9). The in-hospital mortality was 17% (1/6) in patients treated with open abdomen therapy, of whom five were managed with stomas. Smoking cessation, careful patient selection and procedure planning with identification of severe shaggy aortas might prevent mesenteric embolization during aorto-iliac procedures. In suspected cases of mesenteric embolization, elevated myoglobin and arterial blood lactate may be indicative of this complication. Aspartate and alanine aminotranferases, as well as pancreatic amylase, are also relevant tests to assess the extent of organ ischaemia. Damage control with open abdomen therapy and the creation of stomas seem justifiable in order to improve survival in this complex situation.",

A comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy of multiple medication combinations is missing. To summarize and compare the meta-analytically determined efficacy of pharmacologic combination strategies of antipsychotic drugs in adults with schizophrenia. Systematic search of PubMed and PsycInfo until May 13, 2016. Meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials comparing the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs combined with other antipsychotic or nonantipsychotic medications vs placebos or antipsychotic monotherapy among adults with schizophrenia. Independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed the quality of the methods of the included meta-analyses using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR), adding 6 new items to rate their quality. Effect sizes, expressed as standardized mean difference /Hedges g or risk ratio, were compared separately for combinations with any antipsychotic drug and for combinations with clozapine. The primary outcome was total symptom reduction. Secondary outcomes included positive and negative symptoms, treatment recommendations by authors, study-defined inefficacies, cognitive and depressive symptoms, discontinuation of treatment because of any cause, and inefficacies or intolerabilities. Of 3397 publications, 29 meta-analyses testing 42 combination strategies in 381 individual trials and among 19 833 participants were included. For total symptom reductions, 32 strategies that augmented any antipsychotic drug and 5 strategies that augmented clozapine were examined. Fourteen combination treatments outperformed controls (standard mean difference /Hedges g, -1.27 [95% CI, -2.35 to -0.19] to -0.23 [95% CI, -0.44 to -0.02]; P = .05). No combination strategies with clozapine outperformed controls. The quality of the methods of the meta-analyses was generally high (mean score, 9 of a maximum score of 11) but the quality of the meta-analyzed studies was low (mean score, 2.8 of a maximum score of 8). Treatment recommendations correlated with the effect size (correlation coefficient, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.35-0.10; P < .001), yet effect sizes were inversely correlated with study quality (correlation coefficient, -0.06; 95% CI, 0.01 to -0.12; P = .02). Meta-analyses of 21 interventions fully or partially recommended their use, with recommendations being positively correlated with the effect sizes of the pooled intervention. However, the effect sizes were inversely correlated with meta-analyzed study quality, reducing confidence in these recommendations. Higher - quality trials and patient -based meta-analyses are needed to determine whether subpopulations might benefit from combination treatment, as no single strategy can be recommended for patients with schizophrenia based on the current meta-analytic literature.",

Moreover, higher prevalence of depression and comorbidities in women than men implies the need to include the sex variable in studies on animal models of depression. The present study was therefore initiated to evaluate the effect of sex and ovarian hormones on depression -like phenotypes in mice exposed to a 21-day Chronic Variable Mild Stress (CVMS) paradigm. Adult male, intact female and, ovariectomized (OVX) female mice exposed to CVMS displayed despair behavior, a depression -like phenotype, in all the groups. However, intact females alone, but not males and OVX females, showed anhedonia, another depression -like phenotype. At the molecular level, the expression of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), a neuropeptide associated with depression, and few other stress -specific genes CRH, NR3C1, CART, and NPY were measured in the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) region of the reward circuitry. There was a significant decrease in the BDNF protein expression along with an increase in the mRNA expression of CRH, NR3C1, CART, and NPY in intact females, but not in the other two groups of mice. OVX females resembled males in behavioral and molecular responses to CVMS. 17β-Estradiol (E2) administration, not Progesterone (P4), to OVX female stress mice, mitigated despair and enhanced hedonic capacity with an increased expression of BDNF in PFC. This study strengthens the evidence for the beneficial effects of E2 administration in stress condition.",

We investigated whether the immune response of humans differs after contact with C. burnetii isolates from different host origins or with different multilocus variable number of tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) genotypes. Cytokine responses were measured in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated with 16 C. burnetii isolates with known MLVA genotype from goats, sheep, cattle, acute and chronic Q fever patients. Coxiella burnetii isolates originating from cattle induce significantly more IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-22 than the isolates from goats, sheep or chronic Q fever patients. Comparing the cytokine induction of the isolates based on their MVLA genotype did not reveal differences in response between the MLVA genotypes. The proinflammatory cytokine response induced in human PBMCs by C. burnetii isolates from cattle may explain the low incidence of human Q fever outbreaks caused by cattle. The cytokine profile of PBMCs stimulated with C. burnetii isolates from chronic Q fever patients resembles isolates from goats. Furthermore, cytokine responses seem to be depending on host origin than on MLVA genotype.",

Paulownia witches' broom is one of the most destructive diseases threatening Paulownia production. The molecular mechanisms associated with this disease have been investigated by transcriptome sequencing, but changes in protein abundance have not been investigated with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation. Previous results have shown that methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) can help Paulownia seedlings recover from the symptoms of witches' broom and reinstate a healthy morphology. In this study, a transcriptomic-assisted proteomic technique was used to analyze the protein changes in phytoplasma - infected Paulownia tomentosa seedlings, phytoplasma - infected seedlings treated with 20 and 60 mg·L(-1) MMS, and healthy seedlings. A total of 2,051 proteins were obtained, 879 of which were found to be differentially abundant in pairwise comparisons between the sample groups. Among the differentially abundant proteins, 43 were related to Paulownia witches' broom disease and many of them were annotated to be involved in photosynthesis, expression of dwarf symptom, energy production, and cell signal pathways.",

      "document": "Fairness: the hidden challenge for competency-based postgraduate medical education programs Competency-based medical education systems allow institutions to individualize teaching practices to meet the needs of diverse learners. Yet, the focus on continuous improvement and individualization of curricula does not exempt programs from treating learners in a fair manner. When learners fail to meet key competencies and are placed on probation or dismissed from training programs, issues of fairness may form the basis of their legal claims. In a literature search, we found no in-depth examination of fairness. In this paper, we utilize a systems lens to examine fairness within postgraduate medical education contexts, focusing on educational opportunities, assessment practices, decision-making processes, fairness from a legal standpoint, and fairness in the context of the learning environment. While we provide examples of fairness issues within US training programs, concerns regarding fairness are relevant in any medical education system which utilizes a competency-based education framework. Assessment oversight committees and annual programmatic evaluations, while recommended, will not guarantee fairness within postgraduate medical education programs, but they can provide a window into 'hidden' threats to fairness, as everything from training experiences to assessment practices may be examined by these committees. One of the first steps programs can take is to recognize that threats to fairness may exist in any educational program, including their own, and begin conversations about how to address these issues.",

A total of 1118 individuals were enrolled, including 415 SLE patients, 139 AASV patients, and 564 healthy controls. FCGR3A and FCGR3B copy numbers (CNs) were determined by both a paralogue ratio test and TaqMan quantitative PCR assay. In the susceptibility associations, a low FCGR3B CN was significantly associated with SLE (p = 5.01 × 10(-3); odds ratio (OR) 1.71; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-2.48) and AASV (p = 0.04; OR = 1.72; 95% CI 1.02-2.88). A low FCGR3A CN was also significantly associated with SLE (p = 6.02 × 10(-3); OR 2.72; 95% CI 1.30-5.71) and AASV (p = 0.042; OR 2.64; 95% CI 1.00-6.93). Further subphenotype analysis revealed that low CNs of FCGR3A and FCGR3B were significantly associated with clinical manifestations in SLE and AASV patients. Therefore, in this case-control study, we identified low CNs of FCGR2A and FCGR3B to be common risk factors for SLE and AASV.",

We show here that nitric oxide (NO) generated by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) controls the coalescence of protein kinase C-θ (PKC-θ) at the central supramolecular activation cluster (c-SMAC) of the IS. eNOS translocated with the Golgi to the IS and partially colocalized with F-actin around the c-SMAC. This resulted in reduced actin polymerization and centripetal retrograde flow of β-actin and PKC-θ from the lamellipodium-like distal (d)-SMAC, promoting PKC-θ activation. Furthermore, eNOS -derived NO S-nitrosylated β-actin on Cys374 and impaired actin binding to profilin-1 (PFN1), as confirmed with the transnitrosylating agent S-nitroso-L-cysteine (Cys-NO). The importance of NO and the formation of PFN1-actin complexes on the regulation of PKC-θ was corroborated by overexpression of PFN1 - and actin-binding defective mutants of β-actin (C374S) and PFN1 (H119E), respectively, which reduced the coalescence of PKC-θ at the c-SMAC. These findings unveil a novel NO -dependent mechanism by which the actin cytoskeleton controls the organization and activation of signaling microclusters at the IS.",

Whether such traits reflect actual dispersal is often untested. Such tests are important because maximum dispersal distances may not be achieved and many dispersal events may be unsuccessful (without reproduction). For insects, many habitat patches harbour ' resident ' species that are present as larvae (sedentary) and adults (winged and dispersing), and ' itinerant ' species present only as adults that have dispersed from elsewhere and fail to reproduce. We tested whether itinerancy patterns were temporally consistent, and whether itinerant and resident species differed in wing morphology, a strong correlate of flight capability. Over 3 years and at multiple locations in a 22 km stream length, we sampled larvae and adults of caddisflies in the genus Ecnomus to categorize species as residents or itinerants. Flight capacity was measured using wing size (length and area) and shape parameters (aspect ratio and the second moment of wing area). Three species of Ecnomus were residents and three species were itinerants, and patterns were consistent over 3 years. On average, itinerant species had larger wings, suggesting a greater capacity to fly long distances. Wing shape differed between species, but did not differ systematically between residents and itinerants. Wing morphology was associated with actual but not effective dispersal of some species of Ecnomus. Morphological traits may have weak explanatory power for hypotheses regarding the demographic connectedness of populations, unless accompanied by data demonstrating which dispersers contribute new individuals to populations.",

Clonal complex 398 (CC398) is the most prevalent LA-MRSA clone, and has been reported from several geographical settings, including Europe, the Americas and Asia. To understand the factors contributing to the global dissemination of this clone, we analysed CC398 MRSA isolates from New Zealand (NZ), a geographically isolated country with an economy strongly dependent on livestock farming. We supplemented the NZ CC398 MRSA collection with global datasets of CC398 MRSA and CC398 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. Here, we demonstrate multiple sporadic incursions of CC398 MRSA into NZ, as well as recent importation and spread of a swine -associated clade related to the European LA-MRSA lineage. Within a larger global phylogenomic framework, Bayesian modelling suggested that this NZ clade emerged in the late 2000s, with a probable origin in swine from Western Europe. Elucidating the factors responsible for the incursion and spread of LA-MRSA in geographically distant regions, such as NZ, provides important insights into global pathways of S. aureus transmission, and will inform strategies to control importation and spread.",

Inactivation of ANGPTL4 decreases plasma triglycerides and reduces risk of coronary artery disease. Unfortunately, targeting ANGPTL4 for the therapeutic management of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis is hampered by the observation that mice and monkeys in which ANGPTL4 is inactivated exhibit lipid accumulation in mesenteric lymph nodes. In mice these pathological events exclusively unfold upon feeding a high saturated fatty acid diet and are followed by an ultimately lethal pro-inflammatory response and chylous ascites. Here we show that Angptl4-/- mice fed a diet rich in trans fatty acids develop numerous lipid -filled giant cells in their mesenteric lymph nodes, yet do not have elevated serum amyloid and haptoglobin, do not exhibit ascites, and survive, unlike Angptl4-/- mice fed a saturated fatty acid -rich diet. In RAW264.7 macrophages the saturated fatty acid palmitate markedly increases markers of inflammation and the unfolded protein response, whereas the trans-unsaturated elaidate and the cis-unsaturated oleate have the opposite effect. In conclusion, trans and saturated fatty acids have very distinct biological effects. Furthermore, lipid accumulation in mesenteric lymph nodes is uncoupled from activation of an acute-phase response and chylous ascites, suggesting that ANGPTL4 should not be fully dismissed as target for dyslipidemia.",

MCT was administered to BALB/c Slc-nu/nu mice, and PH was induced in mice 4 weeks later. Fresh hUCB - MNCs harvested from a human donor after her delivery were injected intravenously into those PH mice. The medial thickness of pulmonary arterioles, ratio of right ventricular to septum plus left ventricular weight (RV / S + LV), and ratio of acceleration time to ejection time of pulmonary blood flow waveform (AT / ET) were determined 4 weeks after hUCB - MNC transplantation. To reveal the incorporation into the lung, CMTMR - labeled hUCB - MNCs were observed in the lung by fluorescent microscopy. DiR-labeled hUCB - MNCs were detected in the lung and other organs by bioluminescence images. Medial thickness, RV / S + LV and AT / ET were significantly improved 4 weeks after hUCB - MNC transplantation compared with those in mice without hUCB - MNC transplantation. CMTMR - positive hUCB - MNCs were observed in the lung 3 hours after transplantation. Bioluminescence signals were detected more strongly in the lung than in other organs for 24 hours after transplantation. The results indicate that hUCB - MNCs are incorporated into the lung early after hUCB - MNC transplantation and improve MCT - induced PH. J. Med. Invest. 64: 43-49, February, 2017.",

      "document": "Epistatic influence in tomato Ve1 - mediated resistance Resistance to Verticillium wilt disease is associated with the tomato Ve-locus; however, the individual functional roles of Ve1 and Ve2 in host plants remain controversial. As a first step towards Ve mutational analyses in planta, the Ve1 coding region from a resistant tomato near-isoline (cv. Craigella GCR218) was introduced into a susceptible near-isoline (cv. Craigella GCR26). 35S:Ve1 plants segregated into two distinct classes; roughly half were resistant and half were susceptible. Ve1 transcript levels were upregulated in both classes compared to wild-type plants, showing stable transgenic expression. Expression analysis of Ve2 revealed that mRNA levels were similar between 35S:Ve1 and wild-type tomatoes, demonstrating that Ve1 transgene introduction does not alter endogenous Ve2 expression. Overall, the results of this study confirm the functional role of Ve1 protein in resistance to the vascular fungal pathogen V. dahliae race 1 (Vd1), but suggest that a yet undefined factor exerts an epistatic influence on the Ve1 gene.

      "document": "Dietary grape seed proanthocyanidins inactivate regulatory T cells by promoting NER - dependent DNA repair in dendritic cells in UVB - exposed skin Ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation induces regulatory T cells (Treg cells) and depletion of these Treg cells alleviates immunosuppression and inhibits photocarcinogenesis in mice. Here, we determined the effects of dietary grape seed proanthocyanidins (GSPs) on the development and activity of UVB - induced Treg cells. C3H/HeN mice fed a GSPs (0.5%, w/w)- supplemented or control diet were exposed to UVB (150 mJ/cm2) radiation, sensitized to 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) and sacrificed 5 days later. FACS analysis indicated that dietary GSPs decrease the numbers of UVB - induced Treg cells. ELISA analysis of cultured sorted Treg cells indicated that secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines (interleukin-10, TGF-β) was significantly lower in Treg cells from GSPs - fed mice. Dietary GSPs also enhanced the ability of Treg cells from wild-type mice to stimulate production of IFNγ by T cells. These effects of dietary GSPs on Treg cell function were not found in XPA - deficient mice, which are incapable of repairing UVB - induced DNA damage. Adoptive transfer experiments revealed that naïve recipients that received Treg cells from GSPs - fed UVB - irradiated wild-type donors that had been sensitized to DNFB exhibited a significantly higher contact hypersensitivity (CHS) response to DNFB than mice that received Treg cells from UVB - exposed mice fed the control diet. There was no significant difference in the CHS response between mice that received Treg cells from UVB - irradiated XPA - deficient donors fed GSPs or the control diet. Furthermore, dietary GSPs significantly inhibited UVB - induced skin tumor development in wild-type mice but not in XPA - deficient mice. These results suggest that GSPs inactivate Treg cells by promoting DNA repair in dendritic cells in UVB - exposed skin.",

      "document": "An approach for liposome immobilization using sterically stabilized micelles (SSMs) as a precursor for bio-layer interferometry - based interaction studies Non-fluidic bio-layer interferometry (BLI) has rapidly become a standard tool for monitoring almost all biomolecular interactions in a label-free, real-time and high-throughput manner. High - efficiency screening methods which measure the kinetics of liposomes with a variety of compounds require the immobilization of liposomes. In this work, a method is described for immobilizing liposomes for interaction studies, based on the biophysical principles of this biosensor platform. The immobilization approach includes the loading of DSPE-PEG(2000) - biotin containing sterically stabilized micelles (SSMs) which are restructured in a buffer change step, resulting in an accessible substrate for liposome immobilization. Liposomes in a concentration of 5mM of varying composition and fluidity were immobilized on the sensor surface by inserting the hydrophobic residues of the former loaded SSMs. This proof of principle was carried out using Cytochrome C as a membrane-interacting model protein. The binding of Cytochrome C to the immobilized liposomes was demonstrated, and the derived kinetic and affinity constants were similar to values given in the literature. In order to obtain a detailed understanding of this surface, and to show the integrity of the liposomes, confocal fluorescence microscopy was used. Images of immobilized liposomes containing calcein in the aqueous core indicated intact vesicles. A combination of this simple liposome immobilization approach, the possibility of automation on BLI systems with high throughput within an acceptable timescale and excellent reproducibility makes this assay suitable for basic research as well as for industrial and regulatory applications.",

      "document": "The role of leptin in energy expenditure: The hypothalamic perspective The adipocyte derived hormone leptin is a peripheral signal that informs the brain about the metabolic status of an organism. Although traditionally viewed as an appetite suppressing hormone, studies in the past decade have highlighted the role of leptin in energy expenditure. Leptin has been shown to increase energy expenditure in particular through its effects on the cardiovascular system and brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis via the hypothalamus. The current review summarizes the role of leptin signaling in various hypothalamic nuclei and its effects on the sympathetic nervous system to influence blood pressure, heart rate and brown adipose tissue thermogenesis. Specifically, the role of leptin signaling on three different hypothalamic nuclei, the dorsomedial hypothalamus, the ventromedial hypothalamus, and the arcuate nucleus, is reviewed. It is known that all these brain regions influence the sympathetic nervous system activity and thereby regulate BAT thermogenesis and the cardiovascular system. Thus, the current work focuses on how leptin signaling in specific neuronal populations within these hypothalamic nuclei influences certain aspects of energy expenditure.",

Protein-coding gene targets of RAS signaling have been characterized extensively, but long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) regulated by these processes have not. Using a custom-designed lncRNA microarray, we identified the lncRNA Orilnc1 as a genetic target of RAS that is critical for RAS oncogenicity. Orilnc1 expression was regulated by RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling via the transcription factor AP1. Orilnc1 was highly expressed in BRAF-mutant cancers such as melanoma. Silencing of Orilnc1 blocked tumor cell proliferation and growth in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, Orilnc1 blockade reduced expression of Cyclin E1 and induced G1/S cell cycle arrest in tumor cells. Taken together, our results identify Orilnc1 as a novel, non-protein mediator of RAS/RAF activation which may serve as a therapeutic target in RAS/RAF-driven cancers.",

We analyzed family dietary intake according to the head of household's perception of satisfaction with food consumed by the family. Households (n = 13,351) that participated in the Brazilian Household Budget Survey and the National Dietary Survey were classified as satisfied or dissatisfied with the food consumed in the home. We compared the family dietary intake of the two groups considering their socio-demographic characteristics. Satisfied families (n = 4429) reported statistically higher intake (in grams/1000 kcal) of vegetables (47.3 vs 33.7), fruits (46.9 vs 21.4), sugar-sweetened beverages (118 vs 71.7), milk and dairy (57.9 vs 34.6), and ultra-processed products (18.6 vs 9.8); and lower intake of rice (86.2 vs 112), beans (91.7 vs 136), and meat (76.5 vs 84.0) when compared to dissatisfied families (n = 1717). Among satisfied families, in the youngest group we found lower consumption of fruits and higher intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and ultra-processed products when compared to the oldest group. Also among satisfied families, those in the highest per capita income group presented higher intake of fruits and lower intake of beans than those in the lowest income group. Satisfied families in the highest income group also consumed more fruits and less beans than dissatisfied families in the same income group. Socio-demographic characteristics may influence perception of satisfaction with food consumed and potentially influence the success of public health efforts to offer nutrition guidance for families satisfied with diets that may or may not be comprised of healthy food and beverages.",

      "document": "Compensatory and decompensatory alterations in cardiomyocyte Ca(2+) dynamics in hearts with diastolic dysfunction following aortic banding At the cellular level cardiac hypertrophy causes remodelling, leading to changes in ionic channel, pump and exchanger densities and kinetics. Previous studies have focused on quantifying changes in channels, pump s and exchangers without quantitatively linking these changes with emergent cellular scale functionality. Two biophysical cardiac cell models were created, parameterized and validated and are able to simulate electrophysiology and calcium dynamics in myocytes from control sham operated rats and aortic - banded rats exhibiting diastolic dysfunction. The contribution of each ionic pathway to the calcium kinetics was calculated, identifying the L-type Ca(2+) channel and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase as the principal regulators of systolic and diastolic Ca(2+), respectively. Results show that the ability to dynamically change systolic Ca(2+), through changes in expression of key Ca(2+) modelling protein densities, is drastically reduced following the aortic banding procedure; however the cells are able to compensate Ca(2+) homeostasis in an efficient way to minimize systolic dysfunction. Elevated left ventricular afterload leads to myocardial hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, cellular remodelling and compromised calcium dynamics. At the cellular scale this remodelling of the ionic channels, pumps and exchangers gives rise to changes in the Ca(2+) transient. However, the relative roles of the underlying subcellular processes and the positive or negative impact of each remodelling mechanism are not fully understood. Biophysical cardiac cell models were created to simulate electrophysiology and calcium dynamics in myocytes from control rats (SHAM) and aortic - banded rats exhibiting diastolic dysfunction. The model parameters and framework were validated and the fitted parameters demonstrated to be unique for explaining our experimental data. The contribution of each ionic pathway to the calcium kinetics was calculated, identifying the L-type Ca(2+) channel (LCC) and the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) -ATPase (SERCA) as the principal regulators of systolic and diastolic Ca(2+), respectively. In the aortic banding model, the sensitivity of systolic Ca(2+) to LCC density and diastolic Ca(2+) to SERCA density decreased by 16-fold and increased by 23%, respectively, relative to the SHAM model. The energy cost of ionic homeostasis is maintained across the two models. The models predict that changes in ionic pathway densities in compensated aortic banding rats maintain Ca(2+) function and efficiency. The ability to dynamically alter systolic function is significantly diminished, while the capacity to maintain diastolic Ca(2+) is moderately increased.",

Mecasermin isolated from inclusion bodies in extracts of E.coli must be refolded to acquire sufficient activity. However, there is no rapid analytical method for monitoring refolding during the purification process. We prepared mecasermin drug product, in-process samples during the oxidation of mecasermin, forced-reduced mecasermin, and aerially oxidized mecasermin after forced reduction. Desalted mecasermin samples were analyzed using MALDI-ISD. The peak intensity ratio of product to precursor ion was determined. The charge state distribution (CSD) of mecasermin ions was evaluated using ESI-MS coupled with SEC-mode HPLC. The drift time and collision cross-sectional areas (CCS) of mecasermin ions were evaluated using ESI-IMS-MS coupled with SEC-mode HPLC. MALDI-ISD data, CSD values determined using ESI-MS, and the CCS acquired using ESI-IMS-MS revealed the relationship between the folded and unfolded proteoforms of forced-reduced mecasermin and aerially oxidized mecasermin with the free-SH: protein ratio of mecasermin drug product. The collision cross-sectional area, which is determined using ESI-IMS-MS, provided proteoform information through rapid monitoring (<2 min) of in-process samples during the manufacture of mecasermin.

      "document": "Personalized axillary dissection: the number of excised lymph nodes of nodal-positive breast cancer patients has no significant impact on relapse-free and overall survival Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has replaced axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for the staging of clinically node-negative breast cancer patients (BCP), demonstrating equivalent survival to ALND while resulting in reduced morbidity. ALND has remained the standard of care for the majority of BCP with clinical axillary metastases or metastases found on SLN biopsy. More recently, it is debated whether ALND could be avoided not only in SLN - negative BCP but also in selected SLN - positive disease or even in all patients. This analysis of pN+ BCP shows the impact of the number of excised lymph nodes on RFS and OAS adjusted by age, tumor size, intrinsic subtypes and adjuvant systemic therapy. In this retrospective, multicenter cohort study, we investigated data from 2992 pN+ primary BCP recruited from 17 participating certified breast cancer centers in Germany between 2001 and 2008 within the BRENDA study group. The median number of excised lymph nodes was 17. The number of excised lymph nodes was neither significant for RFS (p = 0.085) nor for OAS (p = 0.285). Adjustments were made for age, tumor size and intrinsic subtypes. The most important significant parameters for RFS were intrinsic subtypes (p < 0.001) and tumor size (p < 0.001) and for OAS age (p < 0.001) and intrinsic subtypes (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in RFS and OAS in any subgroup stratified by the number of excised lymph nodes. Only for T3 / T4 tumors, there is a very small significant advantage of ALND for RFS but not for OAS. After adjusting in addition by guideline adherence of adjuvant systemic therapy (AST), intrinsic subtypes and guideline-adherent AST are the most important significant (p < 0.001) parameters for RFS and OAS. The number of excised lymph nodes of pN+ BCP neither correlates with RFS nor with OAS. Survival of pN+ BCP is primarily determined by the biology and the guideline-adherent AST based on the corresponding intrinsic subtypes. These results support the omission of a radical ALND at least for pN+ patients scheduled for breast-conserving surgery (not mastectomy), provided they receive whole breast irradiation and guideline-adherent AST.",

      "document": "It's not all about moral reasoning: Understanding the content of Moral Case Deliberation Moral Case Deliberation is one form of clinical ethics support described as a facilitator -led collective moral reasoning by healthcare professionals on a concrete moral question connected to their practice. Evaluation research is needed, but, as human interaction is difficult to standardise, there is a need to capture the content beyond moral reasoning. This allows for a better understanding of Moral Case Deliberation, which may contribute to further development of valid outcome criteria and stimulate the normative discussion of what Moral Case Deliberation should contain. To explore and compare the content beyond moral reasoning in the dialogue in Moral Case Deliberation at Swedish workplaces. A mixed-methods approach was applied for analysing audio-recordings of 70 periodic Moral Case Deliberation meetings at 10 Swedish workplaces. Moral Case Deliberation facilitators and various healthcare professions participated, with registered nurses comprising the majority. Ethical considerations: No objection to the study was made by an Ethical Review Board. After oral and written information was provided, consent to be recorded was assumed by virtue of participation. Other than ' moral reasoning ' (median (md): 45% of the spoken time), the Moral Case Deliberations consisted of 'reflections on the psychosocial work environment ' to a varying extent (md: 29%). Additional content comprised 'assumptions about the patient's psychosocial situation ' (md: 6%), 'facts about the patient's situation ' (md: 5%), 'concrete problem-solving ' (md: 6%) and ' process ' (md: 3%). The findings suggest that a restorative function of staff's wellbeing in Moral Case Deliberation is needed, as this might contribute to good patient care. This supports outcome criteria of improved emotional support, which may include relief of moral distress. However, facilitators need a strategy for how to proceed from the participants ' own emotional needs and to develop the use of their emotional knowing to focus on the ethically difficult patient situation.",

Sixteen asymptomatic female participants (22 ± 3 years, 163 ± 0,06 cm, 57,5 ± 5 kg), free of any neurological or musculoskeletal disorders, performed six trials of the sit-to-stand task at maximum speed, in four experimental conditions varying the mobility of the cervical spine by means of three different splints. A six-channel force plate, which collected the reaction forces and moments applied at its top surface, was used to calculate the center of pressure displacements along the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axes. The local accelerations of the head, spine, and pelvis, were assessed by three pairs of accelerometers, oriented along the vertical and anterior-posterior axes. Restriction of cervical spine mobility resulted in an increased duration of the focal movement, associated with longer and larger postural adjustments. These results suggest that restricted cervical spine mobility impairs the posturo-kinetic capacity during the sit-to-stand task, leading to a lower motor performance and a reorganization of the anticipatory postural adjustments. In a clinical context, it might be assumed that preserving the articular free play of the cervical spine might be useful to favor STS performance and autonomy.",

      "document": "Galectin-3 is a target for proteases involved in the virulence of Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of skin and soft-tissue infection. The bacterium expresses four major proteases emerging as virulence factors; aureolysin (Aur), V8 protease (SspA), staphopain A (ScpA), and staphopain B (SspB). We hypothesized that human galectin-3, a β-galactoside-binding lectin involved in immune regulation and antimicrobial defense, is a target for these proteases, and that proteolysis of galectin-3 is a novel immune evasion mechanism. Indeed, supernatants from laboratory strains and clinical isolates of S. aureus caused galectin-3 degradation. Similar proteolytic capacity was found in Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates, but not Staphylococcus saprophyticus Galectin-3 -induced activation of the neutrophil NADPH-oxidase was abrogated by bacteria -derived proteolysis of galectin-3, and SspB was identified as the major protease responsible. The impact of galectin-3 and protease expression on S. aureus virulence was studied in a murine skin infection model. In galectin-3(+/+) mice, SspB - expressing S. aureus caused larger lesions and higher bacterial load than protease-lacking bacteria. No such difference was detected in galectin-3(-/-) mice, which also showed smaller lesion size as compared to the galectin-3(+/+) animals. In conclusion, the staphylococcal protease SspB inactivates galectin-3, abrogating its stimulation of oxygen radical production in human neutrophils and increasing tissue damage during skin infection.",

Human vaginal epithelial cells were transfected with HPV-11 L1 expression vector and siRNA - HPV-11 L1 vectors and a control group was transfected with scrambled siRNA. Cell proliferation in each group was analyzed using the MTT assay and the expression of apoptosis -associated proteins was measured by western blot analysis. Compared with the control group, HPV-11 L1 mRNA and protein levels were significantly increased following transfection with the HPV-11 L1 expression vector in cells (P<0.05), but this result was significantly reversed by silencing of HPV-11 L1 (P<0.05). In addition, cell proliferation in the HPV-11 group was lower than that in the control group; however, cell proliferation was significantly increased in cells transfected with silenced L1 compared with that in the control group (P<0.05). Furthermore, silencing of HPV-11 L1 significantly decreased caspase-3 and caspase-9 expressions in cells, whereas the expression was increased in the HPV-11 L1 group (P<0.05). The present study suggested that siRNA -mediated silencing of HPV-11 L1 may have potential therapeutic applications for treating gynecological diseases associated with HPV-11 infection.",

      "document": "The Histone Acetyltransferase Gcn5 Positively Regulates T Cell Activation Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) regulate inducible transcription in multiple cellular processes and during inflammatory and immune response. However, the functions of general control nonrepressed-protein 5 (Gcn5), an evolutionarily conserved HAT from yeast to human, in immune regulation remain unappreciated. In this study, we conditionally deleted Gcn5 (encoded by the Kat2a gene) specifically in T lymphocytes by crossing floxed Gcn5 and Lck-Cre mice, and demonstrated that Gcn5 plays important roles in multiple stages of T cell functions including development, clonal expansion, and differentiation. Loss of Gcn5 functions impaired T cell proliferation, IL-2 production, and Th1 / Th17, but not Th2 and regulatory T cell differentiation. Gcn5 is recruited onto the il-2 promoter by interacting with the NFAT in T cells upon TCR stimulation. Interestingly, instead of directly acetylating NFAT, Gcn5 catalyzes histone H3 lysine H9 acetylation to promote IL-2 production. T cell -specific suppression of Gcn5 partially protected mice from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein - induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an experimental model for human multiple sclerosis. Our study reveals previously unknown physiological functions for Gcn5 and a molecular mechanism underlying these functions in regulating T cell immunity. Hence Gcn5 may be an important new target for autoimmune disease therapy.",

The use of multi targeted drugs is gaining much importance in this scenario.

The present study was designed to examine the molecular mechanism of the anti angiogenic effect of chebulagic acid. Results of our investigations using molecular docking studies and HUVECs in culture suggested that Chebulagic acid inhibited GSK-3β dependent β-catenin phosphorylation, an important mediator of VE-cadherin / β-catenin signaling and VEGFR2 phosphorylation which is an important step involved in VEGF signaling.

      "document": "Similar patterns of neural activity predict memory function during encoding and retrieval Neural networks that span the medial temporal lobe (MTL), prefrontal cortex, and posterior cortical regions are essential to episodic memory function in humans. Encoding and retrieval are supported by the engagement of both distinct neural pathways across the cortex and common structures within the medial temporal lobes. However, the degree to which memory performance can be determined by neural processing that is common to encoding and retrieval remains to be determined. To identify neural signatures of successful memory function, we administered a delayed free-recall task to 187 neurosurgical patients implanted with subdural or intraparenchymal depth electrodes. We developed multivariate classifiers to identify patterns of spectral power across the brain that independently predicted successful episodic encoding and retrieval. During encoding and retrieval, patterns of increased high frequency activity in prefrontal, MTL, and inferior parietal cortices, accompanied by widespread decreases in low frequency power across the brain predicted successful memory function. Using a cross-decoding approach, we demonstrate the ability to predict memory function across distinct phases of the free-recall task. Furthermore, we demonstrate that classifiers that combine information from both encoding and retrieval states can outperform task-independent models. These findings suggest that the engagement of a core memory network during either encoding or retrieval shapes the ability to remember the past, despite distinct neural interactions that facilitate encoding and retrieval.",

This study investigated if audiovisual (AV) integration and associative memory formation rely on overlapping or distinct processes. Our functional magnetic resonance imaging results demonstrate that the neural mechanisms underlying AV integration and associative memory overlap substantially. In particular, activity in anterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) is increased during AV integration and also determines the success of novel AV face - name association formation. Dynamic causal modeling results further demonstrate how the anterior STS interacts with the associative memory system to facilitate successful memory formation for AV face - name associations. Specifically, the connection of fusiform gyrus to anterior STS is enhanced while the reverse connection is reduced when participants subsequently remembered both face and name. Collectively, our results demonstrate how multisensory associative memories can be formed for subsequent retrieval.",

      "document": "Personalized axillary dissection: the number of excised lymph nodes of nodal-positive breast cancer patients has no significant impact on relapse-free and overall survival Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has replaced axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for the staging of clinically node-negative breast cancer patients (BCP), demonstrating equivalent survival to ALND while resulting in reduced morbidity. ALND has remained the standard of care for the majority of BCP with clinical axillary metastases or metastases found on SLN biopsy. More recently, it is debated whether ALND could be avoided not only in SLN - negative BCP but also in selected SLN - positive disease or even in all patients. This analysis of pN+ BCP shows the impact of the number of excised lymph nodes on RFS and OAS adjusted by age, tumor size, intrinsic subtypes and adjuvant systemic therapy. In this retrospective, multicenter cohort study, we investigated data from 2992 pN+ primary BCP recruited from 17 participating certified breast cancer centers in Germany between 2001 and 2008 within the BRENDA study group. The median number of excised lymph nodes was 17. The number of excised lymph nodes was neither significant for RFS (p = 0.085) nor for OAS (p = 0.285). Adjustments were made for age, tumor size and intrinsic subtypes. The most important significant parameters for RFS were intrinsic subtypes (p < 0.001) and tumor size (p < 0.001) and for OAS age (p < 0.001) and intrinsic subtypes (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in RFS and OAS in any subgroup stratified by the number of excised lymph nodes. Only for T3 / T4 tumors, there is a very small significant advantage of ALND for RFS but not for OAS. After adjusting in addition by guideline adherence of adjuvant systemic therapy (AST), intrinsic subtypes and guideline-adherent AST are the most important significant (p < 0.001) parameters for RFS and OAS. The number of excised lymph nodes of pN+ BCP neither correlates with RFS nor with OAS. Survival of pN+ BCP is primarily determined by the biology and the guideline-adherent AST based on the corresponding intrinsic subtypes. These results support the omission of a radical ALND at least for pN+ patients scheduled for breast-conserving surgery (not mastectomy), provided they receive whole breast irradiation and guideline-adherent AST.",

In this study, we tested cervical tissues at various stages of tumor progression for 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels and also DNA promoter methylation profile of a panel of genes for its diagnostic potential. In total, 5-methylcytosine, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, and promoter methylation of 33 genes were evaluated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based technique, and bisulfate-based next generation sequencing. The 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine contents were significantly reduced in squamous cell carcinoma and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed a significant difference in (1) 5-methylcytosine between normal and squamous cell carcinoma tissues (area under the curve = 0.946) and (2) 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels among normal, squamous intraepithelial lesions and squamous cell carcinoma. Analyses of our next generation sequencing results and data from five independent published studies consisting of 191 normal, 10 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, 21 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and 335 malignant tissues identified a panel of nine genes (ARHGAP6, DAPK1, HAND2, NKX2-2, NNAT, PCDH10, PROX1, PITX2, and RAB6C) which could effectively discriminate among the various groups with sensitivity and specificity of 80%-100% (p < 0.05). Furthermore, 12 gene promoters (ARHGAP6, HAND2, LHX9, HEY2, NKX2-2, PCDH10, PITX2, PROX1, TBX3, IKBKG, RAB6C, and DAPK1) were also methylated in one or more of the cervical cancer cell lines tested. The global and gene - specific methylation of the panel of genes identified in our study may serve as useful biomarkers for the early detection and clinical management of cervical cancer.",

In this study, a sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the quantification of ATE in rat plasma. Protein precipitation was applied as plasma clean-up procedure; the electrospray ionization was operated in its positive ion mode while ATE and formononetin (internal standard) were measured by multiple reactions monitoring (ATE: m/z 313.1→298.1; formononetin: 269.2→213.3). This LC-MS/MS method displayed good selectivity, sensitivity (lower limit of quantification =2.5ng/ml), accuracy (both intra- and inter-day analytical recovery within 100±10%) and precision (both intra- and inter-day RSD <10%). The matrix effect was found to be insignificant. The pharmacokinetic profiles of ATE were subsequently examined in Sprague-Dawley rats after single oral administration (10mg/kg). When given in an aqueous suspension, ATE was slowly absorbed with quite low plasma exposure (AUC). Fasting further attenuated its oral absorption and led to ∼70% drops in average maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) and AUC. When dosed in a solution formulated with 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, the oral absorption of ATE was substantially improved with ∼500% increases in average Cmax and AUC. Clearly, aqueous solubility has been identified as a barrier to the oral absorption of ATE. The information obtained from this study will facilitate further medicinal exploration on ATE.",

      "document": "Platelet proteome reveals novel pathways of platelet activation and platelet - mediated immunoregulation in dengue Dengue is the most prevalent human arbovirus disease worldwide. Dengue virus (DENV) infection causes syndromes varying from self-limiting febrile illness to severe dengue. Although dengue pathophysiology is not completely understood, it is widely accepted that increased inflammation plays important roles in dengue pathogenesis. Platelets are blood cells classically known as effectors of hemostasis which have been increasingly recognized to have major immune and inflammatory activities. Nevertheless, the phenotype and effector functions of platelets in dengue pathogenesis are not completely understood. Here we used quantitative proteomics to investigate the protein content of platelets in clinical samples from patients with dengue compared to platelets from healthy donors. Our assays revealed a set of 252 differentially abundant proteins. In silico analyses associated these proteins with key molecular events including platelet activation and inflammatory responses, and with events not previously attributed to platelets during dengue infection including antigen processing and presentation, proteasome activity, and expression of histones. From these results, we conducted functional assays using samples from a larger cohort of patients and demonstrated evidence for platelet activation indicated by P-selectin (CD62P) translocation and secretion of granule-stored chemokines by platelets. In addition, we found evidence that DENV infection triggers HLA class I synthesis and surface expression by a mechanism depending on functional proteasome activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cell-free histone H2A released during dengue infection binds to platelets, increasing platelet activation. These findings are consistent with functional importance of HLA class I, proteasome subunits, and histones that we found exclusively in proteome analysis of platelets in samples from dengue patients. Our study provides the first in-depth characterization of the platelet proteome in dengue, and sheds light on new mechanisms of platelet activation and platelet - mediated immune and inflammatory responses.",

      "document": "In Vitro Differentiation of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells into Trophoblastic Cells The placenta is the first organ to develop during embryogenesis and is required for the survival of the developing embryo. The placenta is comprised of various trophoblastic cells that differentiate from the extra-embryonic trophectoderm cells of the preimplantation blastocyst. As such, our understanding of the early differentiation events of the human placenta is limited because of ethical and legal restrictions on the isolation and manipulation of human embryogenesis. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are a robust model system for investigating human development and can also be differentiated in vitro into trophoblastic cells that express markers of the various trophoblast cell types. Here, we present a detailed protocol for differentiating hPSCs into trophoblastic cells using bone morphogenic protein 4 and inhibitors of the Activin / Nodal signaling pathways. This protocol generates various trophoblast cell types that can be transfected with siRNAs for investigating loss-of-function phenotypes or can be infected with pathogens. Additionally, hPSCs can be genetically modified and then differentiated into trophoblast progenitors for gain-of-function analyses. This in vitro differentiation method for generating human trophoblasts starting from hPSCs overcomes the ethical and legal restrictions of working with early human embryos, and this system can be used for a variety of applications, including drug discovery and stem cell research.",

In this study, we tested cervical tissues at various stages of tumor progression for 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels and also DNA promoter methylation profile of a panel of genes for its diagnostic potential. In total, 5-methylcytosine, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, and promoter methylation of 33 genes were evaluated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based technique, and bisulfate-based next generation sequencing. The 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine contents were significantly reduced in squamous cell carcinoma and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed a significant difference in (1) 5-methylcytosine between normal and squamous cell carcinoma tissues (area under the curve = 0.946) and (2) 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels among normal, squamous intraepithelial lesions and squamous cell carcinoma. Analyses of our next generation sequencing results and data from five independent published studies consisting of 191 normal, 10 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, 21 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and 335 malignant tissues identified a panel of nine genes (ARHGAP6, DAPK1, HAND2, NKX2-2, NNAT, PCDH10, PROX1, PITX2, and RAB6C) which could effectively discriminate among the various groups with sensitivity and specificity of 80%-100% (p < 0.05). Furthermore, 12 gene promoters (ARHGAP6, HAND2, LHX9, HEY2, NKX2-2, PCDH10, PITX2, PROX1, TBX3, IKBKG, RAB6C, and DAPK1) were also methylated in one or more of the cervical cancer cell lines tested.

TRPM2 -mediated Ca(2+) signaling has been implicated in the aggravation of inflammatory diseases. Therefore, the development of TRPM2 inhibitors to prevent the aggravation of these diseases is expected. We recently reported that some Tyrphostin AG-related compounds inhibited the H2O2 - induced activation of TRPM2 by scavenging the intracellular hydroxyl radical. In the present study, we examined the effects of AG-related compounds on H2O2 - induced cellular responses in human monocytic U937 cells, which functionally express TRPM2. The effects of AG-related compounds on H2O2 - induced changes in intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, and CXCL8 secretion were assessed using U937 cells. Ca(2+) influxes via TRPM2 in response to H2O2 were blocked by AG-related compounds. AG-related compounds also inhibited the H2O2 - induced activation of ERK, and subsequent secretion of CXCL8 mediated by TRPM2 - dependent and - independent mechanisms. Our results show that AG-related compounds inhibit H2O2 - induced CXCL8 secretion following ERK activation, which is mediated by TRPM2 - dependent and - independent mechanisms in U937 cells. We previously reported that AG-related compounds blocked H2O2 - induced TRPM2 activation by scavenging the hydroxyl radical.

      "document": "Tenofovir alafenamide versus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for the treatment of HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B virus infection: a randomised, double-blind, phase 3, non-inferiority trial Tenofovir alafenamide is a novel prodrug formulated to deliver the active metabolite to target cells more efficiently than tenofovir disoproxil fumarate at a lower dose, thereby reducing systemic exposure. In patients with HIV, tenofovir alafenamide was as efficacious as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, with reduced bone and renal toxic effects. We compared the efficacy and safety of the two drugs in patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a non-inferiority study. We did this ongoing double-blind, non-inferiority study in 161 outpatient centres in 19 countries. Patients with chronic HBV infection who were positive for the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either 25 mg tenofovir alafenamide or 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with matching placebo. Randomisation was done by a computer - generated allocation sequence (block size six) stratified by plasma HBV DNA concentration and previous treatment experience. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with HBV DNA less than 29 IU/mL at week 48 in all patients who were randomly assigned and received at least one dose of study drug using a missing-equals-failed approach. The pre-specified non-inferiority margin was 10%. Key prespecified safety endpoints were bone and renal parameters at week 48. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01940471. Of the 1473 patients screened from Sept 11, 2013, to Dec 20, 2014, 875 eligible patients were randomly assigned and 873 received treatment (581 with tenofovir alafenamide and 292 with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate). 371 (64%) patients receiving tenofovir alafenamide had HBV DNA less than 29 IU/mL at week 48, which was non-inferior to the 195 (67%) of patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate who had HBV DNA less than 29 IU/mL (adjusted difference -3·6% [95% CI -9·8 to 2·6]; p =0·25). Patients given tenofovir alafenamide had a significantly smaller decrease in bone mineral density at hip (mean change -0·10% [95% CI -0·29 to 0·09] vs -1·72% [-2·02 to -1·41]; adjusted difference 1·62 [1·27 to 1·96]; p <0·0001) and at spine (mean change -0·42% [-0·66 to -0·17] vs -2·29% [-2·67 to -1·92]; adjusted difference 1·88 [1·44 to 2·31]; p <0·0001) as well as smaller mean increases in serum creatinine at week 48 (0·01 mg/dL [0·00-0·02] vs 0·03 mg/dL [0·02-0·04]; p =0·02). The most common adverse events overall were upper respiratory tract infection (51 [9%] of 581 patients receiving tenofovir alafenamide vs 22 [8%] of 292 patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), nasopharyngitis (56 [10%] vs 16 [5%]), and headache (42 [7%] vs 22 [8%]). 22 (4%) patients receiving tenofovir alafenamide and 12 (4%) patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate experienced serious adverse events, none of which was deemed by the investigator to be related to study treatment. 187 (32%) of 581 patients in the tenofovir alafenamide group and 96 (33%) of 292 patients in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group had grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities, the most common of which were elevations in ALT (62 [11%] of 577 patients receiving tenofovir alafenamide and 36 [13%] of 288 patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) and AST (20 [3%] of 577 patients receiving tenofovir alafenamide and 19 [7%] of 288 patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate). In patients with HBeAg-positive HBV infection, tenofovir alafenamide was non-inferior to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and had improved bone and renal effects. Longer term follow-up is needed to better understand the clinical impact of these changes. Gilead Sciences.",

      "document": "Involvement Of Vascular Aldosterone Synthase In Phosphate - Induced Osteogenic Transformation Of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells Vascular calcification resulting from hyperphosphatemia is a major determinant of mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Vascular calcification is driven by aldosterone -sensitive osteogenic transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). We show that even in absence of exogenous aldosterone, silencing and pharmacological inhibition (spironolactone, eplerenone) of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) ameliorated phosphate - induced osteo- / chondrogenic transformation of primary human aortic smooth muscle cells (HAoSMCs). High phosphate concentrations up-regulated aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) expression in HAoSMCs. Silencing and deficiency of CYP11B2 in VSMCs ameliorated phosphate - induced osteogenic reprogramming and calcification. Phosphate treatment was followed by nuclear export of APEX1, a CYP11B2 transcriptional repressor. APEX1 silencing up-regulated CYP11B2 expression and stimulated osteo- / chondrogenic transformation. APEX1 overexpression blunted the phosphate - induced osteo- / chondrogenic transformation and calcification of HAoSMCs. Cyp11b2 expression was higher in aortic tissue of hyperphosphatemic klotho-hypomorphic (kl/kl) mice than in wild-type mice. In adrenalectomized kl/kl mice, spironolactone treatment still significantly ameliorated aortic osteoinductive reprogramming. Our findings suggest that VSMCs express aldosterone synthase, which is up-regulated by phosphate - induced disruption of APEX1 -dependent gene suppression. Vascular CYP11B2 may contribute to stimulation of VSMCs osteo- / chondrogenic transformation during hyperphosphatemia.",

Its pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Although extensively described in children, it is still incompletely studied in adults. Our objective was to present five adult cases with emphasis on imaging findings and long-term evolution. From 2006 to 2014, we included 5 HIV - infected patients presenting with fusiform cerebral aneurysms. Vessels abnormalities were assessed with brain computed tomography (CT) angiography, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and/or digital subtraction angiography (DSA). All patients had MR assessment of the brain. Clinical and biological data were analyzed. Fusiform aneurysms of carotid terminations extending to middle and anterior cerebral arteries were bilateral in three patients and unilateral in one. More distal fusiform aneurysms were observed in four patients and saccular aneurysms in two patients, two patients suffered from ischemic lesions while none experienced hemorrhage. Unlike recent reviews, our study underlines the low hemorrhagic potential of HIV - AECV and long-term follow-up suggests a monophasic evolution under antiretroviral medication.",

Standardization of stem cell therapy requires application of appropriate methods to evaluate safety and efficac y, including long-term pharmacovigilance. To accomplish this objective, a long-term registry programme was installed. We analysed 150 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, who received intramyocardial CD133+ bone marrow mononuclear stem cell treatment combined with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or CABG alone. The mortality rate, major adverse cerebral and cardiac events, and functional outcome parameters were evaluated for the time period up to 14 years follow-up. As a result, we have stratified the patient population (96 patients) into responders and non-responders. Furthermore, the analysis of relevant predictors of good response to CD133+ bone marrow mononuclear stem cell treatment was performed. Several positive tendencies related to stem cells transplantation were demonstrated. First, no significant difference in major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral events was observed between stem cell and control group up to 14 years follow-up. Second, an improvement of left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) in stem cell group retained for 5 years in contrast with CABG - only group, where no significant changes in LVEF after 2 years were observed. In addition, LVEF under 30% and left ventricle end diastolic diameter above 60 mm were independent predictors of functional response to CD133+ cell therapy. Participants with overt heart failure benefit most from CABG combined with intramyocardial injection of CD133+ bone marrow mononuclear cell within the group. An improvement LVEF in stem cell group remained for 5 years in contrast with the CABG - only group. The patients, in whom the improvement of both LVEF and LVED was observed, have benefited by increased life expectancy.",

      "document": "Dispersal traits may reflect dispersal distances, but dispersers may not connect populations demographically Ecological traits that reflect movement potential are often used as proxies for measured dispersal distances. Whether such traits reflect actual dispersal is often untested. Such tests are important because maximum dispersal distances may not be achieved and many dispersal events may be unsuccessful (without reproduction). For insects, many habitat patches harbour ' resident ' species that are present as larvae (sedentary) and adults (winged and dispersing), and ' itinerant ' species present only as adults that have dispersed from elsewhere and fail to reproduce. We tested whether itinerancy patterns were temporally consistent, and whether itinerant and resident species differed in wing morphology, a strong correlate of flight capability. Over 3 years and at multiple locations in a 22 km stream length, we sampled larvae and adults of caddisflies in the genus Ecnomus to categorize species as residents or itinerants. Flight capacity was measured using wing size (length and area) and shape parameters (aspect ratio and the second moment of wing area). Three species of Ecnomus were residents and three species were itinerants, and patterns were consistent over 3 years. On average, itinerant species had larger wings, suggesting a greater capacity to fly long distances. Wing shape differed between species, but did not differ systematically between residents and itinerants. Wing morphology was associated with actual but not effective dispersal of some species of Ecnomus. Morphological traits may have weak explanatory power for hypotheses regarding the demographic connectedness of populations, unless accompanied by data demonstrating which dispersers contribute new individuals to populations.",

      "document": "Genetic alterations in mesiodens as revealed by targeted next-generation sequencing and gene co-occurrence network analysis Mesiodens is the most common type of supernumerary tooth which includes a population prevalence of 0.15%-1.9%. Alongside evidence that the condition is heritable, mutations in single genes have been reported in few human supernumerary tooth cases. Gene sequencing methods in tradition way are time-consuming and labor-intensive, whereas next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics are cost-effective for large samples and target sizes. We describe the application of a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatics approach to samples from 17 mesiodens patients. Subjects were diagnosed on the basis of panoramic radiograph. A total of 101 candidate genes which were captured custom genes were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500. Multistep bioinformatics processing was performed including variant identification, base calling, and in silico analysis of putative disease - causing variants. Targeted capture identified 88 non-synonymous, rare, exonic variants involving 42 of the 101 candidate genes. Moreover, we investigated gene co-occurrence relationships between the genomic alterations and identified 88 significant relationships among 18 most recurrent driver alterations. Our search for co-occurring genetic alterations revealed that such alterations interact cooperatively to drive mesiodens. We discovered a gene co-occurrence network in mesiodens patients with functionally enriched gene groups in the sonic hedgehog (SHH), bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), and wingless integrated (WNT) signaling pathways.",

      "document": "Museum specimen data reveal emergence of a plant disease may be linked to increases in the insect vector population The emergence rate of new plant diseases is increasing due to novel introductions, climate change, and changes in vector populations, posing risks to agricultural sustainability. Assessing and managing future disease risks depends on understanding the causes of contemporary and historical emergence events. Since the mid-1990s, potato growers in the western United States, Mexico, and Central America have experienced severe yield loss from Zebra Chip disease and have responded by increasing insecticide use to suppress populations of the insect vector, the potato psyllid, Bactericera cockerelli (Hemiptera: Triozidae). Despite the severe nature of Zebra Chip outbreaks, the causes of emergence remain unknown. We tested the hypotheses that 1) B. cockerelli occupancy has increased over the last century in California and 2) such increases are related to climate change, specifically warmer winters. We compiled a dataset of 87,000 museum specimen occurrence records across the order Hemiptera collected between 1900 and 2014. We then analyzed changes in B. cockerelli distribution using a hierarchical occupancy model using changes in background species lists to correct for collecting effort. We found evidence that B. cockerelli occupancy has increased over the last century. However, these changes appear to be unrelated to climate changes, at least at the scale of our analysis. To the extent that species occupancy is related to abundance, our analysis provides the first quantitative support for the hypothesis that B. cockerelli population abundance has increased, but further work is needed to link B. cockerelli population dynamics to Zebra Chip epidemics. Finally, we demonstrate how this historical macro-ecological approach provides a general framework for comparative risk assessment of future pest and insect vector outbreaks.

We focused our attention on the rate of the first PSA increase and on the influence of prostatic inflammation. From 2011 to 2016, 365 men with a previous negative prostate biopsy and persistent elevated PSA levels received dutasteride treatment. The population was followed for a range of 12-48 months. One hundred twelve cases with a confirmed PSA increase >0.5 ng/ml over the nadir value during the follow-up were included in Group A and underwent a new prostate biopsy. In Group A, the PSA increase was associated with PC at the re-biopsy in 66% of cases. The percentage of PSA reduction after 6 months of treatment was not a significant indicator of the risk for PC. The distribution of inflammatory infiltrates significantly (p<00.01) varied from positive to negative prostate biopsies. The relative risk for PC at biopsy significantly increase d according to PSA level during dutasteride. Treatment with dutasteride can help to analyze PSA kinetic.

Although the prevalence of C. burnetii in cattle is much higher than in goats and sheep, infected cattle are rarely associated with human outbreaks. We investigated whether the immune response of humans differs after contact with C. burnetii isolates from different host origins or with different multilocus variable number of tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) genotypes. Cytokine responses were measured in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated with 16 C. burnetii isolates with known MLVA genotype from goats, sheep, cattle, acute and chronic Q fever patients. Coxiella burnetii isolates originating from cattle induce significantly more IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-22 than the isolates from goats, sheep or chronic Q fever patients. Comparing the cytokine induction of the isolates based on their MVLA genotype did not reveal differences in response between the MLVA genotypes. The proinflammatory cytokine response induced in human PBMCs by C. burnetii isolates from cattle may explain the low incidence of human Q fever outbreaks caused by cattle. The cytokine profile of PBMCs stimulated with C. burnetii isolates from chronic Q fever patients resembles isolates from goats. Furthermore, cytokine responses seem to be depending on host origin than on MLVA genotype.",

Here we describe GECCO (Genomic Enrichment Computational Clustering Operation) to analyze somatic noncoding alterations in 308 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAs) and identify commonly mutated regulatory regions. We find recurrent noncoding mutations to be enriched in PDA pathways, including axon guidance and cell adhesion, and newly identified processes, including transcription and homeobox genes. We identified mutations in protein binding sites correlating with differential expression of proximal genes and experimentally validated effects of mutations on expression. We developed an expression modulation score that quantifies the strength of gene regulation imposed by each class of regulatory elements, and found the strongest elements were most frequently mutated, suggesting a selective advantage. Our detailed single-cancer analysis of noncoding alterations identifies regulatory mutations as candidates for diagnostic and prognostic markers, and suggests new mechanisms for tumor evolution.",

This dual- centre study aimed to assess outcome and toxicity of standardized PRRT with (177)Lu-octreotate in a patient population of advanced pulmonary NET of grade 1-2. We retrospectively assessed 22 consecutively patients treated with 4 intended cycles at 3 monthly intervals (mean activity per cycle 7.8±0.68 GBq).

Treatment response consisted of partial response in 6 (27.3%), stable disease in 9 (40.9%), and progressive disease in 7 (31.8%) patients. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was 27 (95% CI, 9-45) and 42 months (95% CI, 25-59), respectively.

Disease progression despite PRRT was associated with shorter survival (median OS 15 vs 53 mo, P<0.001).

      "document": "Pathways and Genes Associated with Immune Dysfunction in Sheep Paratuberculosis Multibacillary and paucibacillary paratuberculosis are both caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis. Multibacillary lesions are composed largely of infected epithelioid macrophages and paucibacillary lesions contain T cells but few bacteria. Multibacillary disease is similar to human lepromatous leprosy, with variable/high levels of antibody and a dysfunctional immune response. Animals with paucibacillary disease have high cell-mediated immunity and variable levels of antibody. This study aims to characterize the immunological dysfunction using TruSeq analysis of the ileocaecal lymph node that drains disease lesions. Immune dysfunction is highlighted by repression of TCR / CD3 genes, T cell co-receptors / co-stimulators, T cell activation and signal-transduction genes. Inflammation was an acute phase response and chronic inflammation, with little evidence of acute inflammation. The high levels of immunoglobulin and plasma cell transcripts is consistent with the anti-MAP antibody responses in paratuberculosis sheep. Also notable was the overwhelming reduction in mast cell transcripts, potentially affecting DC activation of the immune response. This study also shows that there were no fundamental differences in the gene expression patterns in multibacillary and paucibacillary disease, no shift in T cell genes from Th1 to Th2 pattern but rather an incremental decline into immune dysfunction leading to multibacillary pathology.",

Thus, mapping of B-cell epitopes of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) is critical to identify key immunogenic regions of HlyE. A random 20-mer peptide library was used for biopanning with enriched anti-HlyE polyclonal antibodies from typhoid patient sera. Bioinformatic tools were used to refine, analyze and map the enriched peptide sequences against the protein to identify the epitopes. The analysis identified both linear and conformational epitopes on the HlyE protein. The predicted linear GAAAGIVAG and conformational epitope PYSQESVLSADSQNQK were further validated against the pooled sera. The identified epitopes were then used to isolate epitope specific monoclonal antibodies by antibody phage display. Monoclonal scFv antibodies were enriched for both linear and conformational epitopes. Molecular docking was performed to elucidate the antigen-antibody interaction of the monoclonal antibodies against the epitopes on the HlyE monomer and oligomer structure. An in-depth view of the mechanistic and positional characteristics of the antibodies and epitope for HlyE was successfully accomplished by a combination of phage display and bioinformatic analysis. The predicted function and structure of the antibodies highlights the possibility of utilizing the antibodies as neutralizing agents for typhoid fever.",

We analyzed morphology, growth kinetics, and transcriptomic profiles of flagellates cultivated at low (23°C) and elevated (34°C) temperature. When maintained at high temperature, they grew significantly faster, became shorter, with genes involved in sugar metabolism and mitochondrial stress protection significantly upregulated. Comparison with another thermoresistant monoxenous trypanosomatid, Leptomonas seymouri, revealed dramatic differences in transcription profiles of the two species with only few genes showing the same expression pattern. This disparity illustrates differences in the biology of these two parasites and distinct mechanisms of their thermotolerance, a prerequisite for living in warm-blooded vertebrates.",

Alternatively, functional alterations of central nervous system (CNS) cells by the inflammatory milieu within the CNS may be responsible for the development of fatigue. To investigate the effect of structural brain damage and inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) changes on fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS). We determined the association of different clinical, CSF and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters with prevalence and severity of fatigue, as measured by the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions in 68 early MS patients (discovery cohort). We validated our findings in two MS cohorts: the MRI validation cohort (N = 233) for the clinical and MRI parameters, and the CSF validation cohort (N = 81) for the clinical and CSF parameters. Fatigue was associated with clinical disability. Fatigue did not correlate with any CSF parameter but correlated negatively with total and cortical grey matter volume. However, when controlling for Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) in a multivariate model, these associations lost significance. Disability and disease duration best explain fatigue severity but none of the tested MRI or CSF parameter was reliably associated with fatigue.",

The foveal contour was normal preoperatively in all eyes. All cases underwent successful phacovitrectomy with ILM peeling for a thin ERM. The optical coherence tomography (OCT) images were examined before and after the surgery. The changes in the average foveal (1 mm) thickness and the foveal areas within 500 μm from the foveal center were measured. The postoperative changes in the inner and outer retinal areas determined from the cross-sectional OCT images were analyzed. The average foveal thickness and the inner and outer foveal areas increased significantly after the surgery in each of the three cases. The percentage increase in the average foveal thickness relative to the baseline thickness was 26% in Case 1, 29% in Case 2, and 31% in Case 3. The percentage increase in the foveal inner retinal area was 71% in Case 1, 113% in Case 2, and 110% in Case 3, and the percentage increase in foveal outer retinal area was 8% in Case 1, 13% in Case 2, and 18% in Case 3. The increase in the average foveal thickness and the inner and outer foveal areas suggests that a centripetal movement of the inner and outer retinal layers toward the foveal center probably occurred due to the ILM peeling.",

Rapid assessment by first responders / emergency nurses is required to reduce death and disability. Currently, no informatics tools for irritant gas syndrome agent s (IGSA) exposures exist to process victims efficiently, continuously monitor for latent signs/symptoms, or make triage recommendations. This study describes the first step in developing ED informatics tools for chemical incidents: validation of signs/symptoms that characterize an IGSA syndrome. Data abstracted from 146 patients treated for chlorine exposure in one emergency department during a 2005 train derailment and 152 patients not exposed to chlorine (a comparison group) were mapped to 93 possible signs/symptoms within 2 tools (WISER and CHEMM-IST) designed to assist emergency responders / emergency nurses with managing hazardous material exposures. Inferential statistics (χ(2)/ Fisher's exact test) and diagnostics tests were used to examine mapped signs/symptoms of persons who were and were not exposed to chlorine. Three clusters of signs/symptoms are statistically associated with an IGSA syndrome (P < .01): respiratory (shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, and choking); chest discomfort (tightness, pain, and burning), and eye, nose and/or throat (pain, irritation, and burning). The syndrome requires the presence of signs/symptoms from at least 2 of these clusters. The latency period must also be considered for exposed / potentially exposed persons. This study uses actual patient data from a chemical incident to characterize and validate signs/symptoms of an IGSA syndrome. Validating signs/symptoms is the first step in developing new ED informatics tools with the potential to revolutionize the process by which emergency nurses manage triage victims of chemical incidents.",

Two biosensor strains, Chromobacterium violaceum CV026 and Agrobacterium tumefaciens KYC55, were used to detect the quorum sensing (QS) activity of H. alvei H4 and to confirm the existence of AHL -mediated QS system. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) and high resolution triple quadrupole liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis of the AHLs extracted from the culture supernatant of H. alvei H4 revealed the existence of at least three AHL s: N-hexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (C6-HSL), N-(3-oxo-octanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C8-HSL), and N-butyryl-l-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL). This is the first report of the production of C4-HSL by H. alvei. In order to determine the relationship between the production of AHL by H. alvei H4 and bacterial growth, the β-galactosidase assay was employed to monitor AHL activity during a 48-h growth phase. AHLs production reached a maximum level of 134.6 Miller unites at late log phase (after 18 h) and then decreased to a stable level of about 100 Miller unites. AHL production and bacterial growth displayed a similar trend, suggesting that growth of H. alvei H4 might be regulated by QS. The effect of AHLs on biofilm formation of H. alvei H4 was investigated by adding exogenous AHLs (C4-HSL, C6-HSL and 3-oxo-C8-HSL) to H. alvei H4 culture. Biofilm formation was significantly promoted (p < 0.05) by 5 and 10 µM C6-HSL, inhibited (p < 0.05) by C4-HSL (5 and 10 µM) and 5 µM 3-oxo-C8-HSL, suggesting that QS may have a regulatory role in the biofilm formation of H. alvei H4.",

      "document": "Young people, mental health practitioners and researchers co-produce a Transition Preparation Programme to improve outcomes and experience for young people leaving Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) In the UK young people attending child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) are required to move on, either through discharge or referral to an adult service, at age 17/18, a period of increased risk for onset of mental health problems and other complex psychosocial and physical changes. CAMHS transitions are often poorly managed with negative outcomes for young people. Better preparation may improve outcomes and experience. This study aimed to co-produce, with young people who had transitioned or were facing transition from CAMHS, a CAMHS Transition Preparation Programme (TPP), deliverable in routine NHS settings. Eighteen young people, aged 17-22, from three UK National Health Service (NHS) mental health foundation trusts participated in creative, participatory research workshops. Seven parents completed short questionnaires. Thirty clinical staff from two trusts took part in workshops to ensure deliverability of young people's ideas. Young people were offered co-research opportunities. Most young people felt anxious, fearful and uncertain on leaving CAMHS and perceived mental health services as uncaring. Participants outlined transition procedures and drafted a range of preparation activities, centred around dedicated Transition Peer Support and a transition booklet, which should be offered to all CAMHS leavers, irrespective of discharge or transfer to an adult service. Preparation should aim to build confidence to help young people take responsibility for themselves and flourish in the adult world: coping or getting through it was not enough. Some clinicians also felt anxious at transition and recognised the potential impact on young people of poor communication and lack of understanding between services. Parents would appreciate help to support their offspring during the transition period. Clinicians cited lack of funding and inflexible NHS procedures and policies as potential barriers to the implementation of young people's ideas. Nine young people took up co-research opportunities. Mental health services underestimate the anxiety of CAMHS leavers. Young people have clear ideas about the preparation they require to leave CAMHS with the confidence to take responsibility for their own health care. Close collaboration of NHS staff and researchers facilitates the implementation of research findings.",

      "document": "Serum levels of genomic DNA of α1(I) collagen are elevated in scleroderma patients Recent studies have indicated that various nucleic acids are present in human sera, and attracted attention for their potential as novel disease markers in many human diseases. In this study, we tried to evaluate the possibility that DNA and RNA of collagens exist in human sera, and determined whether their serum levels can be useful biomarkers in scleroderma patients. The RNA or DNA of collagens were purified from sera, and detected by polymerase chain reaction or quantitated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Among approximately 18 360 bases of full-length α1(I) collagen DNA, various regions were detected by polymerase chain reaction in human sera. However, α2(I) collagen DNA, α1(I) collagen RNA or α2(I) collagen RNA were not detectable. α1(I) Collagen DNA in sera was quantitative using our method. The levels of serum α1(I) collagen DNA were significantly increased in scleroderma patients compared with healthy control subjects or systemic lupus erythematosus patients. According to the receiver-operator curve analysis, serum α1(I) collagen DNA levels were shown to be effective as a diagnostic marker of scleroderma. Furthermore, when we determined the association of serum α1(I) collagen DNA levels with clinical / laboratory features in scleroderma patients, those with elevated α1(I) collagen DNA levels showed significantly higher prevalence of pitting scars / ulcers. In summary, elevation of serum α1(I) collagen DNA levels in scleroderma patients may be useful as the diagnostic marker, reflecting the presence of vasculopathy. Jou rna",

      "document": "Preliminary results from direct-to-facility vaccine deliveries in Kano, Nigeria As part of its vaccine supply chain redesign efforts, Kano state now pushes vaccines directly from 6 state stores to primary health centers equipped with solar refrigerators. Our objective is to describe preliminary results from the first 20 months of Kano's direct vaccine delivery operations. This is a retrospective review of Kano's direct vaccine delivery program. We analyzed trends in health facility vaccine stock levels, and examined the relationship between stock-out rates and each of cascade vaccine deliveries and timeliness of deliveries. Analysis of vaccination trends was based on administrative data from 27 sentinel health facilities. Costs for both the in-sourced and out-sourced approaches were estimated using a bottoms-up model-based approach. Overall stock adequacy increased from 54% in the first delivery cycle to 68% by cycle 33. Conversely, stock-out rates decreased from 41% to 10% over the same period. Similar trends were observed in the out-sourced and in-sourced programs. Stock-out rates rose incrementally with increasing number of cascade facilities, and delays in vaccine deliveries correlated strongly with stock-out rates. Recognizing that stock availability is one of many factors contributing to vaccinations, we nonetheless compared pre - and post - direct deliveries vaccinations in sentinel facilities, and found statistically significant upward trends for 4 out of 6 antigens. 1 antigen (measles) showed an upward trend that was not statistically significant. Hepatitis b vaccinations declined during the period. Overall, there appeared to be a one- year lag between commencement of direct deliveries and the increase in number of vaccinations. Weighted average cost per delivery is US$29.8 and cost per child immunized is US$0.7 per year. Direct vaccine delivery to health facilities in Kano, through a streamlined architecture, has resulted in decreased stock-outs and improved stock adequacy. Concurrent operation of insourced and outsourced programs has enabled Kano build in-house logistics capabilities.",

A recurrent, mosaic mutation of SMO (c.1234 C>T; p.Leu412Phe) causes CJS. This report describes the gastrointestinal and surgical findings in a baby with CJS who presented with abdominal obstruction and reviews the spectrum of gastrointestinal malformations in this rare disorder. A 41- week, 4,165 g, female presented with craniosynostosis, pre-axial polysyndactyly, and cutaneous findings consistent with a clinical diagnosis of CJS. The infant developed abdominal distension beginning on the second day of life. Surgical exploration revealed an intestinal malrotation for which she underwent a Ladd procedure. Multiple small nodules were found on the surface of the small and large bowel in addition to an apparent intestinal duplication that seemed to originate posterior to the pancreas. Histopathology of serosal nodules revealed bundles of smooth muscle with associated ganglion cells. Molecular analysis demonstrated the SMO c.1234 C>T mutation in varying amounts in affected skin (up to 35%) and intestinal hamartoma (26%). Gastrointestinal features including structural malformations, motility disorders, and upper GI bleeding are major causes of morbidity in CJS. Smooth muscle hamartomas are a recognized feature of children with CJS typically presenting with abdominal obstruction requiring surgical intervention. A somatic mutation in SMO likely accounts for the structural malformations and predisposition to form bowel hamartomas and myofibromas. The mutation burden in the involved tissues likely accounts for the variable manifestations.",

Parents of 178 teens completed the Life Events Checklist to report major events teens had experienced in the last year: 42% experienced 0 to 1 event (n = 75), 32% experienced 2 to 3 events (n = 57), and 26% experienced 4+ events (n = 46). Teens and parents completed validated measures of treatment adherence, diabetes -specific self-efficacy, quality of life, and diabetes -specific family conflict. Parent-youth interview and chart review provided demographics and diabetes management data. Mean number of events / teen was 2.6 ± 2.7 (range = 0-15). The most common events were \" Hospitalization of a family member \" (24%), \" Getting a bad report card \" (20%), \"Serious arguments between parents \" (19%), and \" Serious illness / injury in a family member \" (19%). Compared with teens experiencing 0 to 1 event, teens experiencing 4+ events were less likely to have married parents (P = .01) and a parent with a college degree (P = .006). Teen s with 4+ events had significantly poorer adherence (P = .002 teen, P = .02 parent), lower self-efficacy (P = .03 teen, P < .0001 parent), poorer quality of life (P < .0001 teen, P < .0001 parent), and more conflict (P = .006 teen, P = .02 parent) than teens with fewer events. In a multivariate model (R (2) = 0.21, P < .0001) controlling for demographic and diabetes management characteristics, fewer events was associated with lower A1c (P = .0009). Occurrence of more major life events was associated with poorer diabetes care and A1c and more negative psychosocial qualities in teens with type 1 diabetes.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the osteogenic potential of ECM hydrogels prepared from demineralized and decellularized bovine bone in the presence and absence of osteogenic medium. Culture of C2C12 and mouse primary calvarial cells (mPCs) on decellularized bone ECM (bECM) and demineralized bone matrix (DBM) gels resulted in increased expression of osteogenic gene markers, including a 3.6- and 13.4-fold increase in osteopontin and 15.7- and 27.1-fold increase in osteocalcin when mPCs were cultured upon bECM with basal and osteogenic media, respectively. bECM hydrogels stimulated the osteogenic differentiation of C2C12 and mPCs even in the absence of osteogenic medium.

      "document": "Skin Conductance Responses and Neural Activations During Fear Conditioning and Extinction Recall Across Anxiety Disorders The fear conditioning and extinction neurocircuitry has been extensively studied in healthy and clinical populations, with a particular focus on posttraumatic stress disorder. Despite significant overlap of symptoms between posttraumatic stress disorder and anxiety disorders, the latter has received less attention. Given that dysregulated fear levels characterize anxiety disorders, examining the neural correlates of fear and extinction learning may shed light on the pathogenesis of underlying anxiety disorders. To investigate the psychophysiological and neural correlates of fear conditioning and extinction recall in anxiety disorders and to document how these features differ as a function of multiple diagnoses or anxiety severity. This investigation was a cross-sectional, case-control, functional magnetic resonance imaging study at an academic medical center. Participants were healthy controls and individuals with at least 1 of the following anxiety disorders: generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, and panic disorder. The study dates were between March 2013 and May 2015. Two-day fear conditioning and extinction paradigm. Skin conductance responses, blood oxygenation level-dependent responses, trait anxiety scores from the State Trait Anxiety Inventory - Trait Form, and functiona l connectivity. This study included 21 healthy controls (10 women) and 61 individuals with anxiety disorders (36 women). P values reported for the neuroimaging results are all familywise error corrected. Skin conductance responses during extinction recall did not differ between individuals with anxiety disorders and healthy controls (ηp2 = 0.001, P = .79), where ηp2 is partial eta squared. The anxiety group had lower activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during extinction recall (ηp2 = 0.178, P = .02). A similar hypoactive pattern was found during early conditioning (ηp2 = 0.106, P = .009). The vmPFC hypoactivation was associated with anxiety symptom severity (r = -0.420, P = .01 for conditioning and r = -0.464, P = .004 for extinction recall) and the number of co-occuring anxiety disorders diagnosed (ηp2 = 0.137, P = .009 for conditioning and ηp2 = 0.227, P = .004 for extinction recall). Psychophysiological interaction analyses revealed that the fear network connectivity differed between healthy controls and the anxiety group during fear learning (ηp2 range between 0.088 and 0.176 and P range between 0.02 and 0.003) and extinction recall (ηp2 range between 0.111 and 0.235 and P range between 0.02 and 0.002). Despite no skin conductance response group differences during extinction recall, brain activation patterns between anxious and healthy individuals differed. These findings encourage future studies to examine the conditions longitudinally and in the context of treatment trials to improve and guide therapeutics via advanced neurobiological understanding of each disorder.",

      "document": "RATIONAL DESIGN OF NANOBODY80 LOOP PEPTIDOMIMETICS: TOWARDS BIASED β2 ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR LIGANDS G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play an important role for many cellular responses, and as such their mechanism of action is of utmost interest. To gain insight into the active conformation of GPCRs, the X-ray crystal structures of Nanobody(Nb) -stabilized β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) have been reported. Nb80 in particular is able to bind the intracellular G protein binding site of β2AR and stabilize the receptors in an active conformation. Within Nb80, the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) is responsible for most of the binding interactions. Hence we hypothesized that peptidomimetics of the CDR3 loop might be sufficient for binding to the receptor, inhibiting the interaction of β2AR with intracellular GPCR interacting proteins (e.g. G proteins). Based on previous crystallographic data, a set of peptidomimetics were synthesized which, similarly to the Nb80 CDR3 loop, adopt a  -hairpin conformation. Syntheses, conformationa l analysis, binding and functional in vitro assays, as well as internalization experiments were performed. We demonstrate that peptidomimetics can structurally mimic the CDR3 loop of a Nanobody and its function by inhibiting G protein coupling as measured by partial inhibition of cAMP production.",

      "document": "Detection of AMA-M2 in human saliva: Potentials in diagnosis and monitoring of primary biliary cholangitis Serum anti-mitochondrial antibody type 2 (AMA-M2) is considered as a pivotal biomarker for the diagnosis of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). However, serological tests have many limitations, including inconvenience, invasiveness, and infection risks. Thus, a less invasive approach to detect AMA-M2 titer is desirable. We examined salivary AMA-M2 of potential PBC patients and found that AMA-M2 could be detected only in saliva of serum AMA-M2-positive PBC patients, but not in saliva of serum AMA-M2-negative PBC patients, oral lichen planus patients (OLP) patients, or healthy controls. Furthermore, the concentration of salivary AMA-M2 was positively correlated with the amount of serum AMA-M2 in patients. The salivary inflammatory cytokines were increased in the PBC, consistent with the results of serum test. These findings indicated that saliva might be a less invasive and cost-effective medium to accurately test for AMA-M2 levels and this is a promising development for the diagnosis and monitoring of PBC.",

To make data science more approachable, we explored existing tools and developed a practice that can help data scientists convert existing analytics pipelines to user-friendly analytics APPs with rich interactions and features of real-time analysis. With this practice, data scientists can develop customized analytics pipelines as APPs in Jupyter Notebook and disseminate them to other researchers easily, and researchers can benefit from the shared notebook to perform analysis tasks or reproduce research results much more easily.",

The aim of this study was to compare clinicopathological factors, adverse events, and clinical outcomes between sentinel node mapping (SNM) and SN dissection (SND) groups and assess the clinical utility of SNNS in patients with EGC. The clinical data of 157 patients with EGC, diagnosed as clinical T1N0M0 with tumors ≤ 40 mm, undergoing SNNS between March 2004 and April 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-seven patients were excluded from the analysis. In the remaining 130 patients, 59 and 71 patients underwent standard lymphadenectomy for SNM and SND, respectively. The sentinel node detection rate in the SNM and SND groups was 98.3% (58/59) and 100% (71/71), respectively. Two (3.5%), 15 (25.9%), and 41 (70.7%) patients having sentinel nodes underwent total gastrectomy, proximal gastrectomy (PG), and distal gastrectomy (DG), respectively, in the SNM group. One (1.4%), 5 (7.0%), 10 (14.1%), 39 (54.9%), and 16 (22.5%) patients underwent PG, DG, segmental gastrectomy, local resection, and endoscopic submucosal dissection, respectively, in the SND group. There was no significant difference in postoperative complications between the SNM and SND groups (P = 0.781). Survival did not differ between the both groups (P = 0.856). The present results suggest that personalized surgery with SND provides technical safety and curability related with a favorable survival outcome in patients with EGC.",

      "document": "Quantitative assessment of passive electrical properties of the cardiac T-tubular system by FRAP microscopy Well-coordinated activation of all cardiomyocytes must occur on every heartbeat. At the cell level, a complex network of sarcolemmal invaginations, called the transverse-axial tubular system (TATS), propagates membrane potential changes to the cell core, ensuring synchronous and uniform excitation-contraction coupling. Although myocardial conduction of excitation has been widely described, the electrical properties of the TATS remain mostly unknown. Here, we exploit the formal analogy between diffusion and electrical conductivity to link the latter with the diffusional properties of TATS. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) microscopy is used to probe the diffusion properties of TATS in isolated rat cardiomyocytes: A fluorescent dextran inside TATS lumen is photobleached, and signal recovery by diffusion of unbleached dextran from the extracellular space is monitored. We designed a mathematical model to correlate the time constant of fluorescence recovery with the apparent diffusion coefficient of the fluorescent molecules. Then, apparent diffusion is linked to electrical conductivity and used to evaluate the efficiency of the passive spread of membrane depolarization along TATS. The method is first validated in cells where most TATS elements are acutely detached by osmotic shock and then applied to probe TATS electrical conductivity in failing heart cells. We find that acute and pathological tubular remodeling significantly affect TATS electrical conductivity. This may explain the occurrence of defects in action potential propagation at the level of single T-tubules, recently observed in diseased cardiomyocytes.",

      "document": "Repeatability and agreement of ultrasonography with computed tomography for evaluating forefoot structure in the coronal plane Forefoot structure is important to understand some foot problems such as hallux valgus and metatarsalgia. Ultrasonography (US) is a highly portable, noninvasive, low cost, and fast imaging method, especially when compared to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and radiography. As the use of US for evaluating forefoot bony structure has not been validated, except for the presence of synovitis, erosions and bursitis within the forefoot in people with inflammatory arthritis, the purpose of this study was to determine whether US is a reliable method for evaluating forefoot structure. Sixty feet (30 women, age = 40.1 ± 11.8 years) were examined by US and CT to assess agreement with CT and repeatability of US evaluation of the 2nd metatarsal head height, length between the medial sesamoid bone and 5th metatarsal head, transverse arch height, transverse arch index, sesamoid rotation angle, and area under the transverse arch. The measurement data were evaluated for agreement with CT using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC)3, 1, Pearson correlation coefficient, and Bland-Altman plot, and with ICC1, 1 for repeatability. The ICC3, 1 values of 0.78-0.89, Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.78-0.90, and Bland-Altman plots showed almost perfect agreements between the US and CT method for all parameters, except the area under the transverse arch (AUTA). The ICC1, 1 also showed perfect agreements (0.84-0.92) between two sets of US measurements in all parameters. The US evaluation of forefoot structure in the coronal plane showed good agreement with CT and repeatability of two ultrasonograms in adult women. This reliable evaluation method of forefoot structure can contribute to a quick clinical assessment screening for risk factors of foot problems such as hallux valgus and metatarsalgia. However, because of some limitations such as a lack of inter-observer reliability, more research is needed to validate US evaluation of forefoot structure. The current study (trial registration number: R0297) was approved by the Ethical Committee for Human Experiments of Kyoto University (http://www.ec.med.kyoto-u.ac.jp) on December 3, 2015. The first participant in this study was enrolled on November 17, 2015 and retrospectively registered.",

      "document": "Determinants of Late Tricuspid Regurgitation After Aortic-Mitral Double Valve Replacement The aims of this study are to evaluate the long-term outcomes of double valve replacement (aortic and mitral valves) and to investigate the determinants of late tricuspid regurgitation (TR). A total of 239 consecutive patients who underwent double valve replacement were enrolled. Valve pathology was rheumatic in 86.6% (207/239) and degenerative in 13.4% (32/239) of patients. Among these patients, 116 patients underwent concomitant tricuspid annuloplasty, and follow-up was completed for all 239 patients (mean = 7.3 ± 4.1, maximum = 15.9 years). We used propensity score matching to match 67 patients without tricuspid annuloplasty to the 114 patients who underwent annuloplasty. There was 1 in-hospital death and 9.7% (23/238) of patients experienced late cardiac -related mortality. Analysis of aortic valves indicated that the transprosthetic mean pressure gradient increased with time (13.4 ± 5.2 vs 15.4 ± 9.0 mm Hg, p = 0.002). Aortic transprosthetic mean pressure gradient increased more notably in woman and was associated with late TR (odds ratio 1.1, p = 0.010). In patients with mild TR, those who underwent tricuspid valve repair were less likely to experience a cardiac -related death within 10 years of surgery (hazards ratio 6.1, p = 0.036).",

Twenty-eight male rats were divided into groups: control untreated rats (C), control rats treated with ω-3 PUFAs alone (C-O), rats with pulp exposure -induced AP, and rats with pulp exposure -induced AP treated with ω-3 PUFAs (AP -O). The ω-3 PUFAs were administered orally, once a day, for 15 days before pulp exposure and, subsequently, 30 days after pulp exposure. Rats were killed 30 days after pulp exposure, and jaws were subjected to histologic and immunohistochemical analyses. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed to detect tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase - positive osteoclasts and osteocalcin - positive osteoblasts on the bone surface of periapical area. Results were statistically evaluated by using analysis of variance and Tukey honestly significant difference, and P < .05 was considered statistically significant. The bone resorption lesion was significantly larger in the AP group compared with AP -O, C, and C-O groups (P < .05). The level of inflammatory cell infiltration was significantly elevated, and the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase - positive osteoclasts was significantly higher in the periapical lesions of the AP group compared with AP -O, C, and C-O groups (P < .05). The number of osteocalcin - positive osteoblasts was significantly increased in the AP -O group compared with the AP group (P > .05). Supplementation with ω-3 PUFAs not only suppresses bone resorption but also promotes new bone formation in the periapical area of rats with AP in conjunction with downregulation of inflammatory cell infiltration into the lesion.",

      "document": "EASL Clinical Practice Guidelines: The diagnosis and management of patients with primary biliary cholangitis Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune cholestatic liver disease, which when untreated will culminate in end-stage biliary cirrhosis. Diagnosis is usually based on the presence of serum liver tests indicative of a cholestatic hepatitis in association with circulating antimitochondrial antibodies. Patient presentation and course can be diverse and risk stratification is important to ensure all patients receive a personalised approach to their care. The goals of treatment and management are the prevention of end-stage liver disease, and the amelioration of associated symptoms. Pharmacologic approaches in practice, to reduce the impact of the progressive nature of disease, currently include licensed therapies (ursodeoxycholic acid and obeticholic acid) and off-label therapies (fibric acid derivatives, budesonide). These clinical practice guidelines summarise the evidence for the importance of a structured, life-long and individualised, approach to the care of patients with PBC, providing a framework to help clinicians diagnose and effectively manage patients.",

      "document": "Predictive position computations mediated by parietal areas: TMS evidence When objects move or the eyes move, the visual system can predict the consequence and generate a percept of the target at its new position. This predictive localization may depend on eye movement control in the frontal eye fields (FEF) and the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and on motion analysis in the medial temporal area (MT). Across two experiments we examined whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over right FEF, right IPS, righ t MT, and a control site, peripheral V1 / V2, diminished participants ' perception of two cases of predictive position perception: trans-saccadic fusion, and the flash grab illusion, both presented in the contralateral visual field. In trans-saccadic fusion trials, participants saccade toward a stimulus that is replaced with another stimulus during the saccade. Frequently, predictive position mechanisms lead to a fused percept of pre - and post - saccade stimuli (Paeye et al., 2017). We found that rTMS to IPS significantly decreased the frequency of perceiving trans-saccadic fusion within the first 10min after stimulation. In the flash grab illusion, a target is flashed on a moving background leading to the percept that the target has shifted in the direction of the motion after the flash (Cavanagh and Anstis, 2013). In the first experiment, the reduction in the flash grab illusion after rTMS to IPS and FEF did not reach significance. In the second experiment, using a stronger version of the flash grab, the illusory shift did decrease significantly after rTMS to IPS although not after rTMS to FEF or to MT. These findings suggest that right IPS contributes to predictive position perception during saccades and motion processing in the contralateral visual field.",

      "document": "Immunoassays for riboflavin and flavin mononucleotide using antibodies specific to d-ribitol and d-ribitol-5-phosphate Riboflavin (vitamin B2), a water-soluble vitamin, plays a key role in maintaining human health. Though, numerous methods have been reported for the determination of total riboflavin (TRF) content in foods and biological samples, very few methods are reported for quantifying riboflavin and its coenzymes [flavin mononucleotide (FMN); flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)] individually. Recently, we have demonstrated that antibodies specific to d-ribitol and d-ribitol-5-phosphate also recognize riboflavin and FMN, respectively, and not vice-versa. In this study, we have evaluated these two antibodies for the analysis of riboflavin and FMN by indirect competitive ELISA (icELISA) in selected foods and pharmaceuticals. Under the optimal assay conditions, 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) and limit of detection (LOD, IC10) were 3.41ng/mL and 0.02ng/mL for riboflavin, and 7.84ng/mL and 0.24ng/mL for FMN, respectively, with detectable concentration range between 0.1 and 100ng of analytes and <0.1% cross-reactivity with other water-soluble vitamins. The amounts of TRF in food samples, as analyzed by icELISA using ribitol antibody, were 90-95% of the reported values in the literature or label values. Quantification of individual flavins (riboflavin and FMN) from the same food samples showed variation in their values compared to TRF, and were in good agreement with values obtained from HPLC and AOAC methods. Further, spiking and recovery analysis of food samples and pharmaceuticals showed no significant matrix effects. The immunoassays were validated in terms of accuracy and precision using inter- and intra-assays. The immunoassays developed in this study are sensitive and appears feasible for screening a large number of samples in the quantification of riboflavin and FMN in various biological samples, pharmaceuticals and natural / processed foods.",

Therefore, we now need to identify safe and well tolerated pharmaceutical agents that are able to remodel the microenvironment of solid tumors and enhance chemotherapy. In this study, we repurposed Pirfenidone, a clinically approved anti-fibrotic drug for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, to investigate its possible role on tumor microenvironment normalization. Using two orthotopic mammary tumor models we demonstrate that Pirfenidone reduces collagen and hyaluronan levels and, as a result, significantly increases blood vessel functionality and perfusion and improves the anti-tumor efficacy of doxorubicin. Reduction of extracellular matrix components were mediated via TGFβ signaling pathway inhibition due to downregulation of TGFβ1, COL1A1, COL3A1, HAS2, HAS3 expression levels. Our findings provide evidence that repurposing Pirfenidone could be used as a promising strategy to enhance drug delivery to solid tumors by normalizing the tumor microenvironment.",

      "document": "Similar patterns of neural activity predict memory function during encoding and retrieval Neural networks that span the medial temporal lobe (MTL), prefrontal cortex, and posterior cortical regions are essential to episodic memory function in humans. Encoding and retrieval are supported by the engagement of both distinct neural pathways across the cortex and common structures within the medial temporal lobes. However, the degree to which memory performance can be determined by neural processing that is common to encoding and retrieval remains to be determined. To identify neural signatures of successful memory function, we administered a delayed free-recall task to 187 neurosurgical patients implanted with subdural or intraparenchymal depth electrodes. We developed multivariate classifiers to identify patterns of spectral power across the brain that independently predicted successful episodic encoding and retrieval. During encoding and retrieval, patterns of increased high frequency activity in prefrontal, MTL, and inferior parietal cortices, accompanied by widespread decreases in low frequency power across the brain predicted successful memory function. Using a cross-decoding approach, we demonstrate the ability to predict memory function across distinct phases of the free-recall task. Furthermore, we demonstrate that classifiers that combine information from both encoding and retrieval states can outperform task-independent models. These findings suggest that the engagement of a core memory network during either encoding or retrieval shapes the ability to remember the past, despite distinct neural interactions that facilitate encoding and retrieval.",

Natural bear hybrids and studies of few nuclear genes indicate that gene flow among bears may be more common than expected and not limited to polar and brown bears. Here we present a genome analysis of the bear family with representatives of all living species. Phylogenomic analyses of 869 mega base pairs divided into 18,621 genome fragments yielded a well-resolved coalescent species tree despite signals for extensive gene flow across species. However, genome analyses using different statistical methods show that gene flow is not limited to closely related species pairs. Strong ancestral gene flow between the Asiatic black bear and the ancestor to polar, brown and American black bear explains uncertainties in reconstructing the bear phylogeny. Gene flow across the bear clade may be mediated by intermediate species such as the geographically wide-spread brown bears leading to large amounts of phylogenetic conflict. Genome-scale analyses lead to a more complete understanding of complex evolutionary processes. Evidence for extensive inter-specific gene flow, found also in other animal species, necessitates shifting the attention from speciation processes achieving genome -wide reproductive isolation to the selective processes that maintain species divergence in the face of gene flow.",

      "document": "Annexin A1 nuclear translocation induces retinal ganglion cell apoptosis after ischemia-reperfusion injury through the p65/IL-1β pathway The degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) has been identified as a major problem in glaucoma. Previous studies have indicated an association between annexin A1 (ANXA1) and neuronal cell apoptosis, and RGCs apoptosis in acute ischemia-reperfusion was attributed to an increased production of IL-1β. We found that the expression and nuclear translocation of ANXA1 were upregulated in models of acute ischemia-reperfusion in RGCs in vivo. ANXA1 was found to have a promoting effect on the expression of IL-1β in primary cultured RGCs, which could be inhibited by treatment with ANXA1 shRNA or the p65 inhibitor BAY 11-7082. ANXA1 interacted with p65, and recruited it into the nucleus. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that ANXA1 accumulated at the IL-1β gene promoter. The reduction of p65 nuclear translocation using a membrane-permeable ANXA1 peptide containing a Ser5Ala mutation led to a decrease in the expression of IL-1β, and acute ischemia-reperfusion induced RGCs apoptosis in vivo. These results indicate that in RGCs, ANXA1 increases IL-1β expression by recruiting p65 to the nucleus, which induces cell apoptosis. The obtained results may help the development of a novel treatment strategy against RGCs apoptosis in acute ischemia-reperfusion injury.",

Selection of the route of hysterectomy for benign causes can be influenced by the size and shape of the vagina and uterus; accessibility to the uterus; extent of extrauterine disease; the need for concurrent procedures; surgeon training and experience; average case volume; available hospital technology, devices, and support; whether the case is emergent or scheduled; and preference of the informed patient. Vaginal and laparoscopic procedures are considered \" minimally invasive \" surgical approaches because they do not require a large abdominal incision and, thus, typically are associated with shortened hospitalization and postoperative recovery times compared with open abdominal hysterectomy. Minimally invasive approaches to hysterectomy should be performed, whenever feasible, based on their well-documented advantages over abdominal hysterectomy. The vaginal approach is preferred among the minimally invasive approaches. Laparoscopic hysterectomy is a preferable alternative to open abdominal hysterectomy for those patients in whom a vaginal hysterectomy is not indicated or feasible. Although minimally invasive approaches to hysterectomy are the preferred route, open abdominal hysterectomy remains an important surgical option for some patients. The obstetrician - gynecologist should discuss the options with patients and make clear recommendations on which route of hysterectomy will maximize benefits and minimize risks given the specific clinical situation. The relative advantages and disadvantages of the approaches to hysterectomy should be discussed in the context of the patient 's values and preferences, and the patient and health care provider should together determine the best course of action after this discussion.",

Especially in some patients with large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA), aggressive medical treatments and surgical interventions might be helpful to prevent ND. Therefore, we investigated factors associated with ND in patients with LAA. We studied patients with LAA who were admitted to our hospital. We divided them into 2 groups with (group 1) and without deterioration (group 2), and evaluated their medical records, risk factors, and radiological findings, such as number of diffusion - positive lesion and degree of stenosis. Our study population consisted of 171 patients; 71 (41.5%) did and 100 (58.5%) did not suffer deterioration. By univariate analysis, blood pressure (BP), heart rate, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, number of diffusion - positive lesion, count of red blood cell, high-density lipoprotein, and degree of stenosis differed significantly between the 2 groups. By multivariate analysis, systolic BP (≥170 mm Hg, odds ratio: 7.20, P <.001) was associated with ND. Furthermore, number of diffusion-weighted image (DWI)- positive lesion (≥8), degree of stenosis (>80.0%), and NIHSS score (≥4) were also independent factors associated with ND. High BP, severity of neurological deficit at the time of admission, and radiological findings, such as degree of stenosis and number of DWI - positive lesion, are independently associated with ND in patients with LAA.",

      "document": "Statistical algorithms improve accuracy of gene fusion detection Gene fusions are known to play critical roles in tumor pathogenesis. Yet, sensitive and specific algorithms to detect gene fusions in cancer do not currently exist. In this paper, we present a new statistical algorithm, MACHETE (Mismatched Alignment CHimEra Tracking Engine), which achieves highly sensitive and specific detection of gene fusions from RNA-Seq data, including the highest Positive Predictive Value (PPV) compared to the current state-of-the-art, as assessed in simulated data. We show that the best performing published algorithms either find large numbers of fusions in negative control data or suffer from low sensitivity detecting known driving fusions in gold standard settings, such as EWSR1-FLI1. As proof of principle that MACHETE discovers novel gene fusions with high accuracy in vivo, we mined public data to discover and subsequently PCR validate novel gene fusions missed by other algorithms in the ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR3. These results highlight the gains in accuracy achieved by introducing statistical models into fusion detection, and pave the way for unbiased discovery of potentially driving and druggable gene fusions in primary tumors.",

      "document": "Cardiac protective effects of remote ischaemic preconditioning in children undergoing tetralogy of fallot repair surgery: a randomized controlled trial Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) by inducing brief ischaemia in distant tissues protects the heart against myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in children undergoing open-heart surgery, although its effectiveness in adults with comorbidities is controversial. The effectiveness and mechanism of RIPC with respect to myocardial IRI in children with tetralogy of Fallot (ToF), a severe cyanotic congenital cardiac disease, undergoing open heart surgery are unclear. We hypothesized that RIPC can confer cardioprotection in children undergoing ToF repair surgery. Overall, 112 ToF children undergoing radical open cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were randomized to either a RIPC group (n = 55) or a control group (n = 57). The RIPC protocol consisted of three cycles of 5-min lower limb occlusion and 5-min reperfusion using a cuff-inflator. Serum inflammatory cytokines and cardiac injury markers were measured before surgery and after CPB. Right ventricle outflow tract (RVOT) tissues were collected during the surgery to assess hypoxia-inducible factor (Hif)-1α and other signalling proteins. Cardiac mitochondrial injury was assessed by electron microscopy. The primary results showed that the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) was longer in the control group than in the RIPC group (52.30 ± 13.43 h vs. 47.55 ± 10.34 h, respectively, P = 0.039). Patients in the control group needed longer post-operative ventilation time compared to the RIPC group (35.02 ± 6.56 h vs. 31.96 ± 6.60 h, respectively, P = 0.016). The levels of post-operative serum troponin-T at 12 and 18 h, CK-MB at 24 h, as well as the serum h-FABP levels at 6 h, after CPB were significantly lower, which was coincident with significantly higher protein expression of cardiac Hif-1α, p-Akt, p-STAT3, p-STAT5, and p-eNOS and less vacuolization of mitochondria in the RIPC group compared to the control group. In ToF children undergoing open heart surgery, RIPC attenuates myocardial IRI and improves the short-term prognosis.",

Average concentrations of PAHs, ClPAHs and BrPAHs during heating periods (with more frequent haze events) were about 3-9 times higher than during non-heating periods. Concentrations of particulate matter (PM)- associated ClPAHs and BrPAHs were higher in heating period than in non-heating period, while for gas - associated ClPAHs and BrPAHs, this distinction was not significant. Congener patterns and congener profiles indicated that with increasing coal combustion during the heating period, concentrations of PAHs and ClPAHs in air were elevated in comparison to the non-heating period.

A propensity score was developed based on age, pre-biopsy serum PSA, biopsy Gleason score, clinical stage, prostate volume, neoadjuvant androgen deprivation status, year of surgery and pre-treatment potency. Outcomes were biochemical progression-free survival (BPFS) using ASTRO and Phoenix criteria, 12-month continence (strictly pad-free) and sexual function (potency sufficient for sexual intercourse). After propensity score - matching, BPFS was compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis and functional outcomes using chi-square tests. In all, 897 men were identified (731 whole - gland and 166 partial). Post-matching, 166 pairs of men were analysed (mean follow-up 31 months).

Of 164 pairs, the 12-month continence rate was similar 94.1% vs. 95.1% (p=0.803). Of 139 pairs, the 12-month rate of successful intercourse was 29.5% for whole - gland and 46.8% for partial ablation (OR 2.1, p=0.003). The incidence of post-treatment urinary retention was 6.0% and 6.6% (p=0.88) following whole - gland and partial ablation respectively and that of rectourethral fistula was 1.2% and 0% (p=0.50) Conclusion: Partial ablation results in better post-treatment sexual function compared to whole - gland ablation in men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer.

      "document": "The recurrent domestication of viruses: major evolutionary transitions in parasitic wasps Several lineages of endoparasitoid wasps, which develop inside the body of other insects, have domesticated viruses, used as delivery tools of essential virulence factors for the successful development of their progeny. Virus domestication s are major evolutionary transitions in highly diverse parasitoid wasps. Much progress has recently been made to characterize the nature of these ancestrally captured endogenous viruses that have evolved within the wasp genomes. Virus domestication from different viral families occurred at least three times in parasitoid wasps. This evolutionary convergence led to different strategies. Polydnaviruses (PDVs) are viral gene transfer agents and virus -like particles of the wasp Venturia canescens deliver proteins. Here, we take the standpoint of parasitoid wasps to review current knowledge on virus domestications by different parasitoid lineages. Then, based on genomic data from parasitoid wasps, PDVs and exogenous viruses, we discuss the different evolutionary steps required to transform viruses into vehicles for the delivery of the virulence molecules that we observe today. Finally, we discuss how endoparasitoid wasps manipulate host physiology and ensure parasitism success, to highlight the possible advantages of viral domestication as compared with other virulence strategies.",

      "document": "Alanine Aminotransferase Is a Marker of Lipotoxicity Consequences and Hyperandrogenemia in Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Several studies have reported higher levels of Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) compared with control subjects. Plasma ALT levels are considered a marker of hepatic lipotoxicity because of their significant associations with different hepatic metabolic dysfunctions, such as hepatic steatosis and hepatic insulin resistance. Retrospective chart review aiming to assess, in PCOS women, the relationship between ALT levels and measures of lipotoxicity consequences that are available clinically, both during fasting and using the oral glucose tolerance test. Women (n = 132) with PCOS, were in average 27.9 years of age, with a mean body mass index of 34.1 kg/m(2) and 49% had a metabolic syndrome (MetS). ALT levels were significantly correlated with homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (r = 0.42, P < 0.001), HDL-C (r = -0.31, P < 0.001), Matsuda index (-0.45, P < 0.001), insulin secretion-sensitivity index-2 (-0.26, P = 0.043), and free testosterone (0.38, P < 0.001), but not with fasting glucose and triglyceride levels. ALT cutoff ≥24 IU/L was associated with all these parameters, including fasting glucose (P = 0.021) and triglyceride levels (P = 0.041), and detected more women with the MetS (59.2% vs. 36.1%, P = 0.008) and whole-body insulin resistance (Matsuda index <12.3 L(2)·10/mmol(2), 85.3% vs. 51.9%, P = 0.004). Plasma ALT levels seem to be a strong predictor not only of liver lipotoxicity but also of systemic lipotoxic consequences and hyperandrogenemia in women with PCOS. Although it requires validation in another study, an ALT cutoff of ≥24 IU/L may help clinicians identify women with increased metabolic risks.",

      "document": "Eye abduction reduces but does not eliminate competition in the oculomotor system Although it is well established that there is a tight coupling between covert attention and the eye movement system there is an ongoing controversy whether this relationship is functional. Previous studies demonstrated that disrupting the ability to execute an eye movement interferes with the allocation of covert attention. One technique that prevents the execution of an eye movement involves the abduction of the eye in the orbit while presenting the stimuli outside of the effective oculomotor range (Craighero, Nascimben, & Fadiga, 2004). Although eye abduction is supposed to disrupt activation of the oculomotor program responsible for the shift of covert attention, this crucial assumption has never been tested experimentally. In the present study we used saccadic curvature to examine whether eye abduction eliminates the target-distractor competition in the oculomotor system. We experimentally reduced the ability to execute saccades by abducting the eye by 30° (monocular vision). This way the peripheral part of the temporal hemifield was located outside the oculomotor range. Participants made a vertical eye movement while on some trials a distractor was shown either inside or outside of the oculomotor range. The curvature away from distractors located outside the oculomotor range was reduced, but not completely eliminated. This confirms that eye abduction influences the activation of the oculomotor program, but points to the fact that other forms of motor planning, such as head movements are also represented in the oculomotor system. The results are in line with the idea that covert attention is an emerging property of movement planning, but is not restricted to saccade planning.",

This delay is mainly attributable to thymic damage after myeloablative chemotherapy and radiotherapy METHODS: We established a model of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in mice and administered ghrelin (GRL) 7 days before the conditioning regimen or the day after BMT. All the GRL - treated mice, especially those administered GRL prior to the conditioning regimen, exhibited more intact thymic architecture and a more rapid restoration of CD4 T lymphocytes after BMT than those of the corresponding control mice. Moreover, the levels of T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) were significantly higher in the mice treated with GRL prior to the conditioning regimen than in the control mice at 28 days after BMT. Our finding s suggest that GRL may be a novel potential therapeutic approach to protecting the thymic epithelium from conditioning-regimen - induced damage and promoting rapid and durable thymic and peripheral CD4 T cell recovery after HSCT.",

      "document": "Comparative kinematic gait analysis in young and old Beagle dogs Age-related involution in dogs involves loss of muscle mass and changes in connective tissue and articular cartilage. The aim of this study was to examine whether an age-related influence on joint mobility can be detected in the absence of diseases. Five young (Ø 2.0 years) and five old (Ø 10.4 years) healthy and sound Beagle dogs were measured during locomotion on a treadmill by computer-assisted gait analysis. Angles of the shoulder, elbow, carpal, hip, stifle and tarsal joints were analyzed, including joint angle progression curves, minimum and maximum joint angles and range of motion (ROM). The old group showed a smaller maximum joint angle (p = 0.037) and ROM (p = 0.037) of the carpal joint and similar tendencies in the shoulder, elbow and carpal joint. The descriptive analysis of the progression curves revealed less flexion and extension of the joints of the forelimb. This indicates restricted joint mobility of the forelimb but primarily of the carpal joint. Findings in the joints of the hindlimb were not consistent; contrasting alterations may be due to a compensatory mechanism. As most alterations were found in the distal joints, these should receive particular attention when examining elderly dogs.",

      "document": "The bachelorette: Female Siamese fighting fish avoid males exposed to an estrogen mimic Due to improper disposal and a lack of removal during the wastewater treatment process, endocrine disrupting chemicals enter aquatic ecosystems where they exert detrimental effects on fish behavior and physiology. Perhaps the most well-studied and prevalent EDC is 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2), an active ingredient in oral contraceptives, which is known to cause dramatic reductions in male -typical behaviors. While it is likely that alterations in male courtship behavior decrease reproductive fitness, this is rarely explicitly examined. To this end, whether EE2 exposure reduces male attractiveness to female Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, was investigated by showing females video images of exposed and unexposed males. Females were randomly assigned to one of two exposure conditions (exposed to EE2, control) and each subject then viewed four different video combinations of male conspecifics (courting exposed + exposed; courting unexposed + unexposed; courting unexposed + exposed; swimming unexposed + exposed). Females, regardless of whether or not they were exposed to EE2, directed markedly less behavior towards exposed males, especially when they viewed an exposed male and an unexposed male simultaneously. These findings demonstrate that EE2 can have significant individual - and population-level consequences on fitness by disrupting sexual selection and, ultimately, the success of exposed males.",

      "document": "Engineering and In Vivo Applications of Riboswitches Riboswitches are common gene regulatory units mostly found in bacteria that are capable of altering gene expression in response to a small molecule. These structured RNA elements consist of two modular subunits: an aptamer domain that binds with high specificity and affinity to a target ligand and an expression platform that transduces ligand binding to a gene expression output. Significant progress has been made in engineering novel aptamer domains for new small molecule inducers of gene expression. Modified expression platforms have also been optimized to function when fused with both natural and synthetic aptamer domains. As this field expands, the use of these privileged scaffolds has permitted the development of tools such as RNA -based fluorescent biosensors. In this review, we summarize the methods that have been developed to engineer new riboswitches and highlight applications of natural and synthetic riboswitches in enzyme and strain engineering, in controlling gene expression and cellular physiology, and in real-time imaging of cellular metabolites and signals.

In hemostasis, although heme has been shown to both induce and inhibit different compartments of hemostasis, its net effect on the hemostatic balance, and the biological relevance of these effects remain to be determined. Herein we evaluated the effect of heme on hemostasis using a global assay able to generate clinically relevant data in several other complex hemostatic diseases. Citrated whole blood samples from healthy participants were stimulated by heme or vehicle and incubated for 4h at 37°C. Rotational thromboelastometry was immediately performed. The participation of tissue factor in coagulation activation was evaluated using inhibitory antibody. Heme was able of inducing ex vivo coagulation activation in whole blood, affecting predominantly parameters associated with the initial phases of clot formation. This activation effect was at least partially dependent on hematopoietic tissue factor, since the effects of heme were partially abrogated by the inhibition of human tissue factor. In conclusion, using a global hemostasis assay, our study confirmed that heme is able to activate coagulation in whole blood, in a tissue factor - dependent way. These findings could explain the disturbance in hemostatic balance observed in conditions associated with the release of heme such as sickle cell disease.",

      "document": "The yeast ADH7 promoter enables gene expression under pronounced translation repression caused by the combined stress of vanillin, furfural, and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural Lignocellulosic biomass conversion inhibitors such as vanillin, furfural, and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) inhibit the growth of and fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A high concentration of each fermentation inhibitor represses translation and increases non-translated mRNAs. We previously reported that the mRNAs of ADH7 and BDH2, which encode putative NADPH- and NADH-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases, respectively, were efficiently translated even with translation repression in response to severe vanillin stress. However, the combined effects of these fermentation inhibitors on the expression of ADH7 and BDH2 remain unclear. We herein demonstrated that exposure to a combined stress of vanillin, furfural, and HMF repressed translation. The protein synthesis of Adh7, but not Bdh2 was significantly induced under combined stress conditions, even though the mRNA levels of ADH7 and BDH2 were up-regulated. Additionally, adh7Δ cells were more sensitive to the combined stress than wild-type and bdh2Δ cells. These results suggest that induction of the ADH7 expression plays a role in the tolerance to the combined stress of vanillin, furfural, and HMF. Furthermore, we succeeded in improving yeast tolerance to the combined stress by controlling the expression of ALD6 with the ADH7 promoter. Our results demonstrate that the ADH7 promoter can overcome the pronounced translation repression caused by the combined stress of vanillin, furfural, and HMF, and also suggest a new gene engineering strategy to breed robust and optimized yeasts for bioethanol production from a lignocellulosic biomass.",

      "document": "An approach for liposome immobilization using sterically stabilized micelles (SSMs) as a precursor for bio-layer interferometry - based interaction studies Non-fluidic bio-layer interferometry (BLI) has rapidly become a standard tool for monitoring almost all biomolecular interactions in a label-free, real-time and high-throughput manner. High - efficiency screening methods which measure the kinetics of liposomes with a variety of compounds require the immobilization of liposomes. In this work, a method is described for immobilizing liposomes for interaction studies, based on the biophysical principles of this biosensor platform. The immobilization approach includes the loading of DSPE-PEG(2000) - biotin containing sterically stabilized micelles (SSMs) which are restructured in a buffer change step, resulting in an accessible substrate for liposome immobilization. Liposomes in a concentration of 5mM of varying composition and fluidity were immobilized on the sensor surface by inserting the hydrophobic residues of the former loaded SSMs. This proof of principle was carried out using Cytochrome C as a membrane-interacting model protein. The binding of Cytochrome C to the immobilized liposomes was demonstrated, and the derived kinetic and affinity constants were similar to values given in the literature. In order to obtain a detailed understanding of this surface, and to show the integrity of the liposomes, confocal fluorescence microscopy was used. Images of immobilized liposomes containing calcein in the aqueous core indicated intact vesicles. A combination of this simple liposome immobilization approach, the possibility of automation on BLI systems with high throughput within an acceptable timescale and excellent reproducibility makes this assay suitable for basic research as well as for industrial and regulatory applications.",

Recipients with cystic fibrosis (CF) may have an increased risk of PTLD although the literature is limited to single center cohorts. Our primary aim is to examine PTLD in an adult lung transplant population by utilizing the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Registry. We studied 30,598 adult recipients of lung transplants performed between 1999 and 2011. The primary outcome was development of and time to PTLD. In addition to indication for transplant, other predictors examined included Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) serostatus, gender, and age. Outcomes were assessed with univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models to obtain hazard ratios (HR). 17% of the cohort had a diagnosis of CF. PTLD developed in 2% of CF recipients compared to 1% for non-CF recipients (p<0.001). Compared to non-CF recipients, CF recipients had higher prevalence of EBV and CMV seronegativity and higher prevalences of high risk EBV and CMV mismatch (D+/R-). There is a significant association between CF and the development of PTLD [HR 1.66 (95% CI 1.30-2.12)]. Stratified multivariable analysis controlling for age revealed EBV negative non-CF recipients have an almost 2 fold increased risk of developing PTLD, whereas EBV negative CF recipients had an almost 6.5 fold increased risk. CF recipients have a higher risk for PTLD compared to non-CF recipients. Further studies are needed to account for additional risk factors and management in this population post-transplant.",

      "document": "Skin Conductance Responses and Neural Activations During Fear Conditioning and Extinction Recall Across Anxiety Disorders The fear conditioning and extinction neurocircuitry has been extensively studied in healthy and clinical populations, with a particular focus on posttraumatic stress disorder. Despite significant overlap of symptoms between posttraumatic stress disorder and anxiety disorders, the latter has received less attention. Given that dysregulated fear levels characterize anxiety disorders, examining the neural correlates of fear and extinction learning may shed light on the pathogenesis of underlying anxiety disorders. To investigate the psychophysiological and neural correlates of fear conditioning and extinction recall in anxiety disorders and to document how these features differ as a function of multiple diagnoses or anxiety severity. This investigation was a cross-sectional, case-control, functional magnetic resonance imaging study at an academic medical center. Participants were healthy controls and individuals with at least 1 of the following anxiety disorders: generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, and panic disorder. The study dates were between March 2013 and May 2015. Two-day fear conditioning and extinction paradigm. Skin conductance responses, blood oxygenation level-dependent responses, trait anxiety scores from the State Trait Anxiety Inventory - Trait Form, and functiona l connectivity. This study included 21 healthy controls (10 women) and 61 individuals with anxiety disorders (36 women). P values reported for the neuroimaging results are all familywise error corrected. Skin conductance responses during extinction recall did not differ between individuals with anxiety disorders and healthy controls (ηp2 = 0.001, P = .79), where ηp2 is partial eta squared. The anxiety group had lower activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during extinction recall (ηp2 = 0.178, P = .02). A similar hypoactive pattern was found during early conditioning (ηp2 = 0.106, P = .009). The vmPFC hypoactivation was associated with anxiety symptom severity (r = -0.420, P = .01 for conditioning and r = -0.464, P = .004 for extinction recall) and the number of co-occuring anxiety disorders diagnosed (ηp2 = 0.137, P = .009 for conditioning and ηp2 = 0.227, P = .004 for extinction recall). Psychophysiological interaction analyses revealed that the fear network connectivity differed between healthy controls and the anxiety group during fear learning (ηp2 range between 0.088 and 0.176 and P range between 0.02 and 0.003) and extinction recall (ηp2 range between 0.111 and 0.235 and P range between 0.02 and 0.002). Despite no skin conductance response group differences during extinction recall, brain activation patterns between anxious and healthy individuals differed. These findings encourage future studies to examine the conditions longitudinally and in the context of treatment trials to improve and guide therapeutics via advanced neurobiological understanding of each disorder.",

      "document": "EBV MicroRNA BART16 Suppresses Type I IFN Signaling Type I IFNs play critical roles in orchestrating the antiviral defense by inducing direct antiviral activities and shaping the adaptive immune response. Viruses have evolved numerous strategies to specifically interfere with IFN production or its downstream mediators, thereby allowing successful infection of the host to occur. The prototypic human gammaherpesvirus EBV, which is associated with infectious mononucleosis and malignant tumors, harbors many immune-evasion proteins that manipulate the adaptive and innate immune systems. In addition to proteins, the virus encodes >40 mature microRNAs for which the functions remain largely unknown. In this article, we identify EBV - encoded miR-BART16 as a novel viral immune-evasion factor that interferes with the type I IFN signaling pathway. miR-BART16 directly targets CREB-binding protein, a key transcriptional coactivator in IFN signaling, thereby inducing CREB-binding protein downregulation in EBV-transformed B cells and gastric carcinoma cells. miR-BART16 abrogates the production of IFN - stimulated genes in response to IFN-α stimulation and it inhibits the antiproliferative effect of IFN-α on latently infected BL cells. By obstructing the type I IFN - induced antiviral response, miR-BART16 provides a means to facilitate the establishment of latent EBV infection and enhance viral replication.",

The effect of the addition of EPE triblock copolymer on the thermal stability, morphology, and mechanical properties of cellulose triacetate films was investigated. The triblock EPE was chosen since PEO blocks interact favorably with CTA, whereas, PPO blocks remain immiscible which provokes a microphase separation. This allows to obtain EPE / CTA composite films with ordered microphase-separated structures where PPO spherical microdomains are well-dispersed in PEO / CTA matrix by simple solvent - evaporation process. During this process, PEO block chains selectively interact with CTA by strong interpolymer hydrogen-bonding while PPO block microseparated.

      "document": "Effects of Environmental Factors and Metallic Electrodes on AC Electrical Conduction Through DNA Molecule Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is one of the best candidate materials for various device applications such as in electrodes for rechargeable batteries, biosensors, molecular electronics, medical - and biomedical - applications etc. Hence, it is worthwhile to examine the mechanism of charge transport in the DNA molecule, however, still a question without a clear answer is DNA a molecular conducting material (wire), semiconductor, or insulator? The answer, after the published data, is still ambiguous without any confirmed and clear scientific answer. DNA is found to be always surrounded with different electric charges, ions, and dipoles. These surrounding charges and electric barrier(s) due to metallic electrodes (as environmental factors (EFs)) play a substantial role when measuring the electrical conductivity through λ-double helix (DNA) molecule suspended between metallic electrodes. We found that strong frequency dependence of AC - complex conductivity comes from the electrical conduction of EFs. This leads to superimposing serious incorrect experimental data to measured ones. At 1 MHz, we carried out a first control experiment on electrical conductivity with and without the presence of DNA molecule. If there are possible electrical conduction due to stray ions and contribution of substrate, we will detected them. This control experiment revealed that there is an important role played by the environmental - charges around DNA molecule and any experiment should consider this role. We have succeeded to measure both electrical conductivity due to EFs (σ ENV) and electrical conductivity due to DNA molecule (σ DNA) independently by carrying the measurements at different DNA - lengths and subtracting the data. We carried out measurements as a function of frequency (f) and temperature (T) in the ranges 0.1 Hz < f < 1 MHz and 288 K < T < 343 K. The measured conductivity (σ MES) portrays a metal -like behavior at high frequencies near 1 MHz. However, we found that σ DNA was far from this behavior because the conduction due to EFs superimposes σ DNA, in particular at low frequencies. By measuring the electrical conductivity at different lengths: 40, 60, 80, and 100 nm, we have succeeded not only to separate the electrical conduction of the DNA molecule from all EFs effects that surround the molecule, but also to present accurate values of σ DNA and the dielectric constant of the molecule ε'DNA as a function of temperature and frequency. Furthermore, in order to explain these data, we present a model describing the electrical conduction through DNA molecule: DNA is a classical semiconductor with charges, dipoles and ions that result in creation of localized energy - states (LESs) in the extended bands and in the energy gap of the DNA molecule. This model explains clearly the mechanism of charge transfer mechanism in the DNA, and it sheds light on why the charge transfer through the DNA can lead to insulating, semiconducting, or metallic behavior on the same time. The model considers charges on DNA, in the extended bands, either could be free to move under electric field or localized in potential wells/hills. Localization of charges in DNA is an intrinsic structural - property of this solitaire molecule. At all temperatures, the expected increase in thermal - induced charge is attributed to the delocalization of holes (or/and electrons) in potential hills (or/and potential wells) which accurately accounts for the total electric and dielectric behavior through DNA molecule. We succeeded to fit the experiment al data to the proposed model with reasonable magnitudes of potential hills/wells that are in the energy range from 0.068 eV.",

      "document": "Daily stressors, trauma exposure, and mental health among stateless Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh The Rohingya of Myanmar are a severely persecuted minority who form one of the largest groups of stateless people; thousands of them reside in refugee camps in southeastern Bangladesh. There has been little research into the mental health consequences of persecution, war, and other historical trauma endured by the Rohingya; nor has the role of daily environmental stressors associated with continued displacement, statelessness, and life in the refugee camps, been thoroughly researched. This cross-sectional study examined: trauma history, daily environmental stressors, and mental health outcomes for 148 Rohingya adults residing in Kutupalong and Nayapara refugee camps in Bangladesh. Results indicated high levels of mental health concerns: posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, somatic complaints, and associated functional impairment. Participants also endorsed local idioms of distress, including somatic complaints and concerns associated with spirit possession. The study also found very high levels of daily environmental stressors associated with life in the camps, including problems with food, lack of freedom of movement, and concerns regarding safety. Regression and associated mediation analyses indicated that, while there was a direct effect of trauma exposure on mental health outcomes (PTSD symptoms), daily environmental stressors partially mediated this relationship. Depression symptoms were associated with daily stressors, but not prior trauma exposure. These findings indicate that daily stressors play a pivotal role in mental health outcomes of populations affected by collective violence and statelessness. It is, therefore, important to consider the role and effects of environmental stressors associated with life in refugee camps on the mental health and psychosocial well-being of stateless populations such as the Rohingya, living in protracted humanitarian environment s.",

In a randomized trial, healthy nulliparous in labor were randomized into one of three intravenous fluid regimens: group 1, the reference group, lactated Ringer's solution infused at a rate of 125 mL/h; group 2, lactated Ringer's solution infused at a rate of 250 mL/h; group 3, 0.9% saline solution boosted with 5% glucose, infused at a rate of 125 mL/h. The primary outcome was labor length from enrollment until delivery. Between December 2010 and July 2015, 300 women were randomized to one of the three groups. Demographic and baseline obstetric characteristics were comparable between the groups. There was no significant difference in the time from enrollment to delivery (p = 0.62). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in second stage duration (p = 0.73), mode of delivery (p = 0.21), cord artery pH and glucose level between the groups. Increasing the intravenous volume of lactated Ringer's solution or substituting to fluid containing 5% glucose solution does not affect labor length.

This study aims to determine if the use of psychotropic medication, in a cohort of women with severe mental illness, increases rates of special care nursery admission and reports differences between antidepressant and antipsychotic medication use either alone or in combination. A retrospective database analysis from a cohort with severe mental illness in pregnancy identified 268 pregnant women who were grouped according to medication type. Demographic, obstetric and neonatal variables were analysed using t-tests, χ(2), analysis of variance and logistic regression analysis for special care nursery admission. The medication groups consisted of: women taking no psychotropic medications (n = 67); those taking antipsychotics (n = 87); those taking antidepressants (n = 55); those taking and a combination of antidepressants/antipsychotics (n = 59). Rates of special care nursery admission in women who took psychotropic medication (41.3%) were elevated compared to those who did not (26.9%) (P = 0.035), and were significantly raised when compared to the general population (P < 0.000). No significant difference occurred between the medication groups. A significant adjusted odds ratio of 2.79 (95% CI 1.286-6.049) was found for special care nursery and psychiatric admission during pregnancy but not for psychotropic medication. Rates of special care nursery admission are elevated in neonates of women with severe mental illness taking psychotropic medication, but were not different for monotherapy or polytherapy when prescribing antidepressants or antipsychotic medication. Additional vulnerability occurs in the neonates of women with a mental illness and paediatric presence at delivery is recommended.",

      "document": "Engagement of cellular prion protein with the co-chaperone Hsp70 / 90 organizing protein regulates the proliferation of glioblastoma stem-like cells Glioblastoma (GBM), a highly aggressive brain tumor, contains a subpopulation of glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) that play roles in tumor maintenance, invasion, and therapeutic resistance. GSCs are therefore a promising target for GBM treatment. Our group identified the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) and its partner, the co-chaperone Hsp70 / 90 organizing protein (HOP), as potential target candidates due to their role in GBM tumorigenesis and in neural stem cell maintenance. GSCs expressing different levels of PrP(C) were cultured as neurospheres with growth factors, and characterized with stem cells markers and adhesion molecules markers through immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. We than evaluated GSC self-renewal and proliferation by clonal density assays and BrdU incorporation, respectively, in front of recombinant HOP treatment, combined or not with a HOP peptide which mimics the PrP(C) binding site. Stable silencing of HOP was also performed in parental and/or PrP(C) -depleted cell populations, and proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo were evaluated. Migration assays were performed on laminin-1 pre-coated glass. We observed that, when GBM cells are cultured as neurospheres, they express specific stemness markers such as CD133, CD15, Oct4, and SOX2; PrP(C) is upregulated compared to monolayer culture and co-localizes with CD133. PrP(C) silencing downregulates the expression of molecules associated with cancer stem cells, upregulates markers of cell differentiation and affects GSC self-renewal, pointing to a pivotal role for PrP(C) in the maintenance of GSCs. Exogenous HOP treatment increases proliferation and self-renewal of GSCs in a PrP(C) -dependent manner while HOP knockdown disturbs the proliferation process. In vivo, PrP(C) and/or HOP knockdown potently inhibits the growth of subcutaneously implanted glioblastoma cells. In addition, disruption of the PrP(C) - HOP complex by a HOP peptide, which mimics the PrP(C) binding site, affects GSC self-renewal and proliferation indicating that the HOP - PrP(C) complex is required for GSC stemness. Furthermore, PrP(C) -depleted GSCs downregulate cell adhesion-related proteins and impair cell migration indicating a putative role for PrP(C) in the cell surface stability of cell adhesion molecules and GBM cell invasiveness, respectively. In conclusion, our results show that the modulation of HOP - PrP(C) engagement or the decrease of PrP(C) and HOP expression may represent a potential therapeutic intervention in GBM, regulating glioblastoma stem-like cell self-renewal, proliferation, and migration.",

      "document": "Silk I and Silk II studied by fast scanning calorimetry Using fast scanning calorimetry (FSC), we investigated the glass transition and crystal melting of samples of B. mori silk fibroin containing Silk I and/or Silk II crystal s. Due to the very short residence times at high temperatures during such measurements, thermal decomposition of silk protein can be significantly suppressed. FSC was performed at 2000K/s using the Mettler Flash DSC1 on fibroin films with masses around 130-270ng. Films were prepared with different crystalline fractions (ranging from 0.26 to 0.50) and with different crystal structures (Silk I, Silk II, or mixed) by varying the processing conditions. These included water annealing at different temperatures, exposure to 50% MeOH in water, or autoclaving. The resulting crystal structure was examined using wide angle X-ray scattering. Degree of crystallinity was evaluated from Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and from analysis of the heat capacity increment at the glass transition temperature. Silk fibroin films prepared by water annealing at 25°C were the least crystalline and had Silk I structure. FTIR and FSC studies showed that films prepared by autoclaving or 50% MeOH exposure were the most crystalline and had Silk II structure. Intermediate crystalline fraction and mixed Silk I / Silk II structure s were found in films prepared by water annealing at 37°C. FSC results indicate that Silk I I crystals exhibit endotherms of narrower width and have higher mean melting temperature Tm(II)=351±2.6°C, compared to Silk I crystals which melt at Tm(I)=292±3.8°C. Films containing mixed Silk I / Silk II structure showed two clearly separated endothermic peaks. Evidence suggests that the two types of crystal s melt separately and do not thermal ly interconvert on the extremely short time scale (0.065s between onset and end of melting) of the FSC experiment. Silkworm silk is a naturally occurring biomaterial. The fibroin component of silk forms two types of crystals. Silk properties depend upon the amount and type of crystals, and their stability. One measure of stability is crystal melting temperature. Crystal s which are more stable have a higher melting temperature. Until now, it has been challenging to study thermal behavior of silk crystal s because they degrade at high temperature. To avoid degradation, and study the melting properties of silk biomaterial, we heated silk at a very fast rate of 2000K/s using a special calorimeter. We have shown that the two crystal types have very different melting temperature s, indicating that one crystal type is much more stable than the other.",

      "document": "Mechanosignaling activation of TGFβ maintains intervertebral disc homeostasis Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration is the leading cause of disability with no disease - modifying treatment. IVD degeneration is associated with instable mechanical loading in the spine, but little is known about how mechanical stress regulates nucleus notochordal (NC) cells to maintain IVD homeostasis. Here we report that mechanical stress can result in excessive integrin αvβ6 -mediated activation of transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), decreased NC cell vacuoles, and increased matrix proteoglycan production, and results in degenerative disc disease (DDD). Knockout of TGFβ type II receptor (TβRII) or integrin αv in the NC cells inhibited functional activity of postnatal NC cells and also resulted in DDD under mechanical loading. Administration of RGD peptide, TGFβ, and αvβ6 - neutralizing antibodies attenuated IVD degeneration. Thus, integrin -mediated activation of TGFβ plays a critical role in mechanical signaling transduction to regulate IVD cell function and homeostasis. Manipulation of this signaling pathway may be a potential therapeutic target to modify DDD.",

In the extensive electronic literature search, keywords such as \" bipolar disorder ,\" \" manic-depressive psychosis ,\" \" bipolar affective disorder ,\" \" bipolar depression ,\" \" cognitive therapy ,\" \" cognitive-behavioral therapy ,\" and \" psychotherapy \" were transformed into MeSH terms, and only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) of relapse rates and Hedges's g, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), for the mean differences in the levels of depression, mania, and psychosocial functioning were calculated. Further subgroup analyses were conducted according to the characteristics of the CBT approaches, patients, and therapists, if the data were available. A total of 19 RCTs comprising 1384 patients with type I or II BD were enrolled in our systematic review and meta-analysis. The main analysis revealed that CBT could lower the relapse rate (pooled OR = 0.506; 95% CI = 0.278 -0.921) and improve depressive symptoms (g = -0.494; 95% CI = -0.963 to -0.026), mania severity (g = -0.581; 95% CI = -1.127 to -0.035), and psychosocial functioning (g = 0.457; 95% CI = 0.106-0.809). CBT is effective in decreasing the relapse rate and improving depressive symptoms, mania severity, and psychosocial functioning, with a mild-to-moderate effect size. Subgroup analyses indicated that improvements in depression or mania are more potent with a CBT treatment duration of ≥90 min per session, and the relapse rate is much lower among patients with type I BD.",

To compare the clinical results of major augmentation rhinoplasty using ACC vs IHCC and analyze the histologic properties of both types of cartilage. A retrospective clinical study was conducted among patients who had undergone rhinoseptoplasty using ACC or IHCC from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2014. Patients were followed up for more than 1 year after surgery and the histologic characteristics of ACC and IHCC were compared. The details of the surgical procedures and complications, including warping, infection, resorption, and/or donor-site morbidity, were evaluated by reviewing medical records and facial photographs. Patients ' subjective satisfaction with aesthetic and functional results was evaluated using a questionnaire. The details of the surgical procedures and complications, including warping, infection, resorption, and/or donor-site morbidity; patients ' subjective satisfaction with aesthetic and functional results ' objective evaluation of surgical outcomes, including symmetry, dorsal height, dorsal length, dorsal width, tip projection, tip rotation, tip width, and overall result; and histologic structures. Objective evaluation of surgical outcomes was graded using the Objective Rhinoplasty Outcome Score, which assessed symmetry, dorsal height, dorsal length, dorsal width, tip projection, tip rotation, tip width, and overall result. Histologic structures were evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin, Masson trichrome, Alcian blue, and Verhoeff elastic stains. A total of 63 patients (27 males and 36 females; mean [SD] age, 30.6 [9.5] years) had rhinoseptoplasty using ACC and 20 (9 males and 11 females; mean [SD] age, 35.4 [15.4] years) had rhinoseptoplasty using IHCC. Among observed complications, only notable resorption occurred more frequently in patients using IHCC (6 [30%]) than with ACC (2 [3%]) (P = .002). In subjective evaluations of aesthetic satisfaction, patients who received ACC showed significantly greater satisfaction (37 of 51 patients [73%] were very satisfied) than did those who received IHCC (6 of 20 [30%]) (P = .001). However, there was no between-group difference in subjective functional outcomes: 4 of 51 patients receiving ACC (8%) and 5 of 20 receiving IHCC (25%) were satisfied (P = .50) and 45 of 51 receiving ACC (88%) and 15 of 20 receiving IHCC (75%) were very satisfied (P = .15). Regarding objective aesthetic outcomes, all scores for both ACC and IHCC were more than 3.1 (between good and excellent). Histologic analyses showed larger, more evenly distributed, uniform chondrocytes and more collagens and proteoglycan contents in ACC than in IHCC. Compared with patients receiving IHCC, those receiving ACC for rhinoseptoplasty showed superior aesthetic satisfaction; ACC also had less frequent notable resorption. Autologous costal cartilage also had better histologic properties than IHCC did, suggesting it as an ideal graft material with less chance of long-term resorption. 3.",

      "document": "Impact and acceptability of lay health trainer -led lifestyle interventions delivered in primary care: a mixed method study Aim To evaluate the impact and acceptability of offering one-to-one lifestyle interventions delivered by lay health trainers in the primary care setting. Chronic conditions represent major causes of ill-health, avoidable disability, pain and anxiety, and tend to be more prevalent in less affluent groups. This is due, in part, to the link between unhealthy lifestyles and lower socio-economic status, although factors such as poverty, worklessness and social exclusion play a larger role. Lay health trainers were introduced in England with the aim of providing personalised lifestyle advice, support and access to services for people living in disadvantaged areas. There is a body of literature on the effectiveness of lay or community health workers in the management of chronic conditions. However, little is known about their potential to promote lifestyle changes in newly diagnosed patients. An innovative health trainer service was piloted in the primary care setting, to work with people diagnosed with a chronic condition or identified as potentially benefitting from one-to-one support. A mixed method study design was utilised. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with practice staff (n=11) and patients (n=15) from one primary care practice in North East England, United Kingdom. Discussions were audio-recorded and analysed using a thematic content approach. Routinely collected pre- / post-intervention data (n=246 patients at baseline; sample sizes varied at end line) were analysed and appropriate descriptive and summary statistics produced. Findings The discussions highlighted a high level of satisfaction with the health trainer model in terms of supporting positive lifestyle changes. Locating the intervention within the practice removed access barriers, particularly for those with long-term conditions. Anecdotal evidence of health improvement was supported by the quantitative analyses, which revealed statistically significant improvements in body mass index, blood pressure, dietary habits, exercise levels, alcohol intake, self-rated health and self-efficacy amongst those who completed the intervention.",

      "document": "Prostaglandin E2 produced following infection with Theiler's virus promotes the pathogenesis of demyelinating disease Infection of various cells with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) activates the TLR - and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5)-dependent pathways, resulting in the production of IL-1β via the activation of caspase-1 upon assembly of the node-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. The role of IL-1β in the pathogenesis of TMEV - induced demyelinating disease was previously investigated. However, the signaling effects of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) downstream of the NLRP3 inflammasome on the immune responses to viral determinants and the pathogenesis of demyelinating disease are unknown. In this study, we investigated the levels of intermediate molecules leading to PGE2 signaling and the effects of blocking PGE2 signaling on the immune response to TMEV infection, viral persistence and the development of demyelinating disease. We demonstrate here that TMEV infection activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and PGE2 signaling much more vigorously in dendritic cells (DCs) and CD11b+ cells from susceptible SJL mice than in cells from resistant B6 mice. Inhibition of virus - induced PGE2 signaling using AH23848 resulted in decreased pathogenesis of demyelinating disease and viral loads in the central nervous system (CNS). In addition, AH23848 treatment caused the elevation of protective early IFN-γ - producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Because the levels of IFN-β were lower in AH23848 - treated mice but the level of IL-6 was similar, over-production of pathogenic IFN-β was modulated and the generation of IFN-γ - producing T cell responses was enhanced by the inhibition of PGE2 signaling. These results strongly suggest that excessive activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and downstream PGE2 signaling contribute to the pathogenesis of TMEV - induced demyelinating disease.",

      "document": "Basic science and pathogenesis of ageing with HIV: potential mechanisms and biomarkers : The increased prevalence of age -related comorbidities and mortality is worrisome in ageing HIV-infected patients. Here, we aim to analyse the different ageing mechanisms with regard to HIV infection. Ageing results from the time - dependent accumulation of random cellular damage. Epigenetic modifications and mitochondrial DNA haplogroups modulate ageing. In antiretroviral treatment -controlled patients, epigenetic clock appears to be advanced, and some haplogroups are associated with HIV infection severity. Telomere shortening is enhanced in HIV-infected patients because of HIV and some nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Mitochondria -related oxidative stress and mitochondrial DNA mutations are increased during ageing and also by some nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Overall, increased inflammation or ' inflammageing ' is a major driver of ageing and could result from cell senescence with secreted proinflammatory mediators, altered gut microbiota, and coinfections. In HIV-infected patients, the level of inflammation and innate immunity activation is enhanced and related to most comorbidities and to mortality. This status could result, in addition to age, from the virus itself or viral protein released from reservoirs, from HIV -enhanced gut permeability and dysbiosis, from antiretroviral treatment, from frequent cytomegalovirus and hepatitis C virus coinfections, and also from personal and environmental factors, as central fat accumulation or smoking. Adaptive immune activation and immunosenescence are associated with comorbidities and mortality in the general population but are less predictive in HIV-infected patients. Biomarkers to evaluate ageing in HIV-infected patients are required. Numerous systemic or cellular inflammatory, immune activation, oxidative stress, or senescence markers can be tested in serum or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The novel European Study to Establish Biomarkers of Human Ageing MARK-AGE algorithm, evaluating the biological age, is currently assessed in HIV-infected patients and reveals an advanced biological age. Some enhanced inflammatory or innate immune activation markers are interesting but still not validated for the patient's follow-up. To be able to assess patients ' biological age is an important objective to improve their healthspan.",

This study aimed to compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes of bilateral decompression via a unilateral approach (BDUA) with transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) and laminectomy with PLIF in the treatment of degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis (DLS) with stenosis. This is a prospective cohort study. This study compared 43 patients undergoing BDUA + TLIF and 40 patients undergoing laminectomy + PLIF. Visual analog scale (VAS) for low back pain and leg pain, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) score. The clinical outcomes were assessed, and intraoperative data and complications were collected. Radiographic outcomes included slippage of the vertebra, disc space height, segmental lordosis, and final fusion rate. This study was supported by a grant from The National Natural Science Foundation of China (81572168). There were significant improvements in clinical and radiographic outcomes from before surgery to 3 months and 2 years after surgery within each group. Analysis of leg pain VAS and ZCQ scores showed no significant differences in improvement between groups at either follow-up. The mean improvements in low back pain VAS and ODI scores were significantly greater in the BDUA + TLIF group than in the laminectomy + PLIF group. No significant difference was found in the final fusion rate at 2-year follow-up. The BDUA + TLIF group had significantly less blood loss, shorter length of postoperative hospital stay, and lower complication rate compared with the laminectomy + PLIF group. When compared with the conventional laminectomy + PLIF procedure, the BDUA + TLIF procedure achieves similar and satisfactory effects of decompression and fusion for DLS with stenosis. The BDUA + TLIF procedure appears to be associated with less postoperative low back discomfort and quicker recovery.",

This study evaluated adequacy in TPs at different diagnostic thresholds. All FNA procedures performed between 2010 and 2015 with matched surgical specimens were analyzed. Cell counts and cytological features were evaluated in all initially nondiagnostic (ND) cases. ND cases were reclassified into TBS categories by 2 pathologists, and the results were compared with surgical outcomes. One hundred forty-six of the 151 cases initially classified as ND were available for review, and they had a mean cell count of 60.5 (standard deviation, 71.4). Interobserver agreement on the reclassification of ND cases was moderate (k = 0.57), and consensus yielded 48 ND cases (33%), 72 benign cases (49%), 24 cases of atypia of undetermined significance (16%), and 2 cases suspicious for malignancy (1%). Lowering the diagnostic threshold to any follicular cells yielded a sensitivity of 92%, a specificity of 60%, a positive predictive value of 59%, a negative predictive value of 92%, and a false-negative rate of 7.7%, whereas the values for the initially diagnostic cases were 93%, 58%, 59%, 93%, and 7.7%, respectively. Including cases with >60 cells but lacking 6 groups containing at least 10 cells did not affect test performance. Nuclear enlargement, pallor, grooves, and the presence of histiocytoid cells in initially ND FNA correlated with malignancy. In thyroid FNA examined with TP only, lowering the adequacy threshold and eliminating the requirement of 6 groups of at least 10 cells did not significantly affect test performance if cytological features associated with malignancy were absent.

      "document": "Influence of the different anteromedial portal on femoral tunnel orientation during anatomic ACL reconstruction The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of femoral tunnel orientation, drilled through the accessory anteromedial (AAM) portal or the high AM portal in anatomic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. In 16 cadaver knees, using o'clock method, centers of the ACL femoral footprint were drilled with an 8-mm reamer via an AAM portal (eight knees) or a high AM portal (eight knees). Computed tomography (CT) scans were taken of each knee. Three-dimensional (3D) models were constructed to identify the femoral tunnel orientation and to create femoral tunnel virtual cylinders for measuring tunnel angles and length. In two of the 16 specimens, we observed a posterior femoral cortex blowout (PFCB) when drilling through a high AM portal. When drilled through the high AM portal, the femoral tunnel length was significantly shorter than when using an AAM portal (30.3 ± 3.8 mm and 38.2 ± 3.1 mm, p < 0.001). The femoral tunnel length was significantly shorter in the group with PFCB compared to the group with no PFCB (25.9 ± 0.6 mm and 35.5 ± 4.5 mm, p = 0.011). The axial obliquity of the high AM portal was significantly higher than that of the AAM portal (52.2 ± 5.9° and 43.0 ± 2.3°, p = 0.003). In anatomic ACL reconstruction, a mal-positioned AM portal can cause abnormal tunnel orientation, which may lead to mechanical failure during ACL reconstruction. Therefore, it is important to select accurate AM portal positioning, and possibly using an AAM portal by measuring an accurate position when drilling a femoral tunnel in anatomic ACL reconstruction.",

      "document": "Radiologic assessment of quality of root canal fillings and periapical status in an Austrian subpopulation - An observational study Progress in endodontic techniques and methodological advances have altered root canal therapy over the last decades. These techniques and methods need periodical documentation. This observational study determined the current prevalence of endodontic treatments, and investigated the relationship of various factors with the periapical status in a Lower Austrian subpopulation. One thousand orthopantomograms of first-time university adult patients radiographed at an outpatient clinic were evaluated. For each tooth, the presence of periradicular pathosis and/or endodontic treatment was recorded, as was the quality of (post-) endodontic treatment (homogeneity and length of root canal fillings; preparation failures; posts / screws; apicoectomies; coronal restorations). Two evaluators, blinded to each other, scored all teeth. In cases of disagreement, they joined for a consensus score. In all, 22,586 teeth were counted. Of these, 2,907 teeth (12.9%) had periapical pathosis, while 2,504 teeth had undergone root canal treatment. Of the endodontically treated teeth, 52% showed no radiographic signs of apical periodontitis, while 44.9% had overt apical lesions, and 3,1% revealed widened periodontal ligament space. The majority of the root canal fillings was inhomogeneous (70.4%); 75.4% were rated too short, and 3.8% too long. The presence of apical pathosis was significantly correlated (odds ratio (OR) 2.556 [confidence interval (CI) 2.076-3.146]; P<0.0001) with poor root canal fillings (length and homogeneity). Posts or screws positively affected periapical status (OR 1.853 [CI 1.219-2.819]; P = 0.004), but endodontically treated posterior teeth were infrequently restored (posts, 7.5%; screws, 2.7%). Best results were found for teeth with both appropriate endodontic treatment and adequate coronal restoration. A high prevalence of periradicular radiolucencies was observed with root canal filled teeth, along with high numbers of unmet treatment needs. Periapical health was associated with adequate root canal obturation and high-grade postendodontic restorations, and quality regarding these latter aspects is considered mandatory to promote periapical health.",

      "document": "ATLANTIC SMALL - MAMMAL: a dataset of communities of rodents and marsupials of the Atlantic Forests of South America The contribution of small mammal ecology to the understanding of macroecological patterns of biodiversity, population dynamics and community assembly has been hindered by the absence of large datasets of small mammal communities from tropical regions. Here we compile the largest dataset of inventories of small mammal communities for the Neotropical region. The dataset reviews small mammal communities from the Atlantic forest of South America, one of the regions with the highest diversity of small mammals and a global biodiversity hotspot, though currently covering less than 12% of its original area due to anthropogenic pressures. The dataset comprises 136 references from 300 locations covering seven vegetation types of tropical and subtropical Atlantic forests of South America, and presents data on species composition, richness, and relative abundance (captures/trap-nights). One paper was published more that 70 years ago but 80% of them were published after 2000. The dataset comprises 53,518 individuals of 124 species of small mammals, including 30 species of marsupials and 94 species of rodents. Species richness averaged 8.2 species (1 - 21) per site. Only two species occurred in more than 50% of the sites (the common opossum, Didelphis aurita and black-footed pigmy rice rat Oligoryzomys nigripes). Mean species abundance varied 430-fold, from 4.3 to 0.01 individuals/trap-night. The dataset also revealed a hyper-dominance of 22 species that comprised 78.29% of all individuals captured, with only seven species representing 44% of all captures. The information contained on this dataset can be applied in the study of macroecological patterns of biodiversity, communities and populations, but also to evaluate the ecological consequences of fragmentation and defaunation, and predict disease outbreaks, trophic interactions and community dynamics in this biodiversity hotspot.

      "document": "Extracellular vesicles from bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells protect against murine hepatic ischemia - reperfusion injury Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and associated inflammation contributes to liver dysfunction and complications after liver surgery and transplantation. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been reported to reduce hepatic IRI because of their reparative immunomodulatory effects in injured tissues. Recent studies have highlighted beneficial effects of extracellular vesicles from MSCs (MSC - EV) on tissue injury. The effects of systemically administered mouse bone marrow derived MSC - EV were evaluated in an experimental murine model of hepatic IRI induced by cross clamping the hepatic artery and portal vein for 90 minutes followed by reperfusion for periods of upto 6 hours. Compared with controls, intravenous administration of MSC - EV 30 minutes prior to IRI dramatically reduced the extent of tissue necrosis, decreased caspase-3 positive and apoptotic cells, and reduced serum aminotransferase levels. MSC - EV increased hepatic mRNA expression of NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 12 (Nlrp12), and the chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1), and reduced mRNA expression of several inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 during IRI. MSC - EV increased cell viability and suppressed both oxidative injury and NF-κB activity in AML12 murine hepatocytes in vitro. In conclusion, the administration of EV derived from bone marrow derived MSCs may ameliorate hepatic IRI by reducing hepatic injury through modulation of the inflammatory response.

      "document": "A comparison of DALYs for periodontal disease in China between 1990 and 2013: insights from the 2013 global burden of disease study China has undergone a rapid demographic and epidemiological transition with fast ecomonic development since the 1980s. Oral health is becoming a major public health problem as the prevalence of non-communicable diseases has greatly increased. Periodontal disease (PD) and caries are among the most prevalent oral diseases. PD accounts for the majority of tooth loss and increases with age. China's third national epidemiological investigation on oral diseases (2005) revealed that periodontitis affected >50% of the adult population. The Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013) have been used to estimate DALYs for 301 acute and chronic diseases and injuries in 188 countries for 1990-2013. The estimation of burden of PD between 1990 and 2013 will provide a unique perspective for planning interventions and developing public health policies for PD even chronic diseases in China. We used the GBD 2013 results for Years of Life Lost (YLLs) and Years Lived with Disability (YLDs) to calculate Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) for PD in China. PD standardized DALYs rate (SDR) per 100,000 persons, the percentage of PD standardized DALYs rate (% PD SDR) in all diseases DALYs, and variance ratio of these two indexes between the years of 1990 and 2013 were compared by province, gender and age groups. Nationwide, compared to 1990, the SDR in 2013 increased slightly from 24.7 to 25.7, while the variance ratio of SDR for provinces in the middle, west and south of China showed a greater variation(4.8-6.2%). The % PD SDR in all disease DALYs increased from 0.06 to 0.11% for all groups. The four highest variance ratios % PD SDR in all diseases DALYs between 1990 and 2013 occurred in the west of China (97, 98.6, 108.4 and 112.8%). The PD SDR changed slightly in the women (20.3 to 21.7), meanwhile the variance ratio of PD SDR and % PD SDR in all diseases DALYs for the women (6.7 and 94.5%) was also higher than for men (2.1 and 60.6%). The highest variance ratio % PD SDR in all oral diseases DALYs occurred between 1990 and 2013 in ages 20 to 24 (50.7%) and 25 to 29 years (50.5%). The PD standardized DALYs rate and % PD SDR in all diseases DALYs in China in 2013 has increased from 1990. Especially, the variance ratio of % PD SDR in all disease DALYs among Young population and women, in the west provinces of China have been becoming the highest in all age groups and national wide. Future intervention measurements should include young women of child-bearing age because women's health impacts infant health. Periodontal disease has risk factors in common with a number of other non-communicable diseases (NCD) and conditions, and focusing on the common behavioral and environmental risk factors would be instrumental in the effective prevention of periodontal disease.",

      "document": "Percentile categorization of QT interval as an approach for identifying adult patients at risk for cardiovascular death The results from studies of the association of QT prolongation with cardiovascular death (CVD) have been inconsistent. The purpose of this study was to compare the major correction formulas to percentile values of QT for heart rate ranges as to their ability to remove the relationship of QT to heart rate and to predict CVD. Participants were 16,531 veterans who had an initial ECG at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Palo Alto, between March 31, 1987, and December 20, 1999, and were followed for CVD. The 4 major correction formulas (Bazett, Fridericia, Framingham, and Hodges) were used to correct QT interval. In addition, the percentiles for heart rate ranges as proposed by Schwartz were calculated. During median follow-up of 17.8 years, 455 CVD events occurred. When compared to the other equations, QTc Bazett had the greatest dependence on heart rate (R(2) = 0.18). The hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for CVD was 2.08 (1.28-3.9) for the 98th percentile of QT interval by heart rate ranges, 2.05 (1.27-3.33) for QTc Bazett, 1.39 (0.44-4.34) for QTc Fridericia, 1.05 (0.26-4.24) for QTc Hodges, and 1.12 (0.28-4.52) for QTc Framingham. The hazard ratio of QTc Bazett was significantly higher than the other formulas except for the 98th percentile method. The Framingham, Hodges, and Fridericia equations remove the effect of heart rate on QT interval significantly better than the Bazett equation. Using QT-interval percentiles based on heart rate provides a consistent approach both for identifying those whose QT intervals prolong due to drugs or other stressors and for assessing CVD risk.",

Our precious studies demonstrated that TCRP1 was involving in chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance of tongue cancer cells, lung cancer cells and ovarian cancer cells. In this study, we showed that TCRP1 overexpression promotes cell transformation and tumorigenesis through hyperphosphorylation of the oncogenic kinase 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) and AKT1, whereas inhibition of PDK1 by OSU-03012 or PDK1 small interfering RNA reversed TCRP1 -mediated cell transformation. Importantly, TCRP1 was able to directly interact with PDK1, and 93-107 amino-acid and 109-124 amino-acid sites of TCRP1 were the common binding domain of PDK1. Moreover, in line with its oncogenic activity, we found that TCRP1 is often overexpressed in human in lung cancer, glioma, ovarian cancer, thyroid cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, stomach cancer and tongue carcinoma tissues. Spearman correlation analysis showed that the expression of TCRP1 has a positive correlation with p-PDK1, as well as p-AKT1 in lung cancer and gliomas tissues. Thus, TCRP1 may be a candidate as human oncoprotein that promotes cancer development by activation of PDK1 / AKT1 signaling.",

      "document": "Comparison of Occlusive and Open Application in a Psoriasis Plaque Test Design, Exemplarily Using Investigations of Mapracorat 0.1% Ointment versus Vehicle and Reference Drugs Psoriasis plaque tests (PPTs) are important tools in the early phases of antipsoriatic drug development. Two distinct PPT design variants (open vs. occluded drug application) are commonly used, but no previous work has aimed to directly compare and contrast their performance. We compared the antipsoriatic efficacy of mapracorat 0.1% ointment and reference drugs reported in 2 separate studies, representing open and occluded PPT designs. The drug effect size was measured by sonography (mean change in echo-poor band thickness), chromametry, and standardized clinical assessment. Antipsoriatic effects were detectable for the study drugs in both occluded and open PPTs. Differences between the potency of antipsoriatic drugs and vehicle were observable. The total antipsoriatic effect size appeared to be higher in the occluded PPT than the open PPT, despite the shorter treatment duration (2 vs. 4 weeks). Effect dynamics over time revealed greater differences between some study drugs in the open PPT compared to the occluded PPT. Taking the higher technical challenges for the open PPT into account, we recommend the occluded PPT as a standard screening setting in early drug development. In special cases, considering certain drug aspects or study objectives that would require procedural adaptations, an open PPT could be the better-suited design. Finally, both PPT models show clear advantages: classification as phase I studies, small number of psoriatic subjects, relatively short study duration, excellent discrimination between compounds and concentrations, parallel measurement of treatment response, and go/no go decisions very early in clinical development.",

A retrospective clinical study was conducted among patients who had undergone rhinoseptoplasty using ACC or IHCC from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2014. Patients were followed up for more than 1 year after surgery and the histologic characteristics of ACC and IHCC were compared. The details of the surgical procedures and complications, including warping, infection, resorption, and/or donor-site morbidity, were evaluated by reviewing medical records and facial photographs. Patients ' subjective satisfaction with aesthetic and functional results was evaluated using a questionnaire. The details of the surgical procedures and complications, including warping, infection, resorption, and/or donor-site morbidity; patients ' subjective satisfaction with aesthetic and functional results ' objective evaluation of surgical outcomes, including symmetry, dorsal height, dorsal length, dorsal width, tip projection, tip rotation, tip width, and overall result; and histologic structures. Objective evaluation of surgical outcomes was graded using the Objective Rhinoplasty Outcome Score, which assessed symmetry, dorsal height, dorsal length, dorsal width, tip projection, tip rotation, tip width, and overall result. Histologic structures were evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin, Masson trichrome, Alcian blue, and Verhoeff elastic stains. A total of 63 patients (27 males and 36 females; mean [SD] age, 30.6 [9.5] years) had rhinoseptoplasty using ACC and 20 (9 males and 11 females; mean [SD] age, 35.4 [15.4] years) had rhinoseptoplasty using IHCC. Among observed complications, only notable resorption occurred more frequently in patients using IHCC (6 [30%]) than with ACC (2 [3%]) (P = .002). In subjective evaluations of aesthetic satisfaction, patients who received ACC showed significantly greater satisfaction (37 of 51 patients [73%] were very satisfied) than did those who received IHCC (6 of 20 [30%]) (P = .001). However, there was no between-group difference in subjective functional outcomes: 4 of 51 patients receiving ACC (8%) and 5 of 20 receiving IHCC (25%) were satisfied (P = .50) and 45 of 51 receiving ACC (88%) and 15 of 20 receiving IHCC (75%) were very satisfied (P = .15). Regarding objective aesthetic outcomes, all scores for both ACC and IHCC were more than 3.1 (between good and excellent). Histologic analyses showed larger, more evenly distributed, uniform chondrocytes and more collagens and proteoglycan contents in ACC than in IHCC. Compared with patients receiving IHCC, those receiving ACC for rhinoseptoplasty showed superior aesthetic satisfaction; ACC also had less frequent notable resorption. Autologous costal cartilage also had better histologic properties than IHCC did, suggesting it as an ideal graft material with less chance of long-term resorption. 3.",

CD177 is expressed in neutrophils specifically and upregulated during inflammation. However, the role of CD177(+) neutrophils in pathogenesis of IBD remains elusive. Expression of CD177 was analysed in peripheral blood and intestinal mucosa from patients with IBD using quantitative RT-PCR, flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. CD177(+) and CD177(-) neutrophils were isolated to determine gene differences by RNA sequencing. Colitis was established in CD177(-/-) and wild-type mice in response to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) insults to determine the role of CD177(+) neutrophils in IBD. CD177(+) neutrophils were markedly increased in peripheral blood and inflamed mucosa from patients with active IBD compared with healthy controls. RNA sequencing revealed that differential gene expression between CD177(+) and CD177(-) neutrophils from patients with IBD was associated with response to bacterial defence, hydrogen peroxide and reactive oxygen species (ROS). CD177(+) neutrophils produced lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines (ie, interferon-γ, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17A), but higher levels of IL-22 and transforming growth factor-β, and exhibited increased bactericidal activities (ie, ROS, antimicrobial peptides, neutrophil extracellular trap) compared with CD177(-) subset. CD177(-/-) mice developed more severe colitis on DSS insults compared with wild-type mice. Moreover, CD177 deficiency led to compromised intestinal barrier and impaired antibacterial immunity through decreased production of IL-22 by CD177(-) neutrophils. CD177(+) neutrophils represent functionally activated population and play a protective role in IBD through increased bactericidal activity and IL-22 production. Targeting CD177 (+) neutrophils may be beneficial for treatment of IBD.",

      "document": "Heightened HIV antibody responses in postpartum women as exemplified by recent infection assays: implications for incidence estimates Laboratory assays that identify recent HIV infections are important for assessing impacts of interventions aimed at reducing HIV incidence. Kinetics of HIV humoral responses can vary with inherent assay properties, and between HIV subtypes, populations and physiological states. They are important in determining mean duration of recent infection (MDRI) for antibody-based assays for detecting recent HIV infections. We determined MDRIs for BED-CEIA, LAg and BRAI assays for 101 seroconverting postpartum women, recruited in Harare in 1997- 2000 during the Zimbabwe Vitamin A for Mothers and Babies (ZVITAMBO) Trial, comparing them against published MDRIs estimated from seroconverting cases in the general population. We also compared MDRIs for women who seroconverted either during the first nine months, or at later stages, postpartum. At cut-offs (C) of 0.8 for BED, 1.5 for LAg and 40% for BRAI, estimated MDRIs for postpartum mothers, were 192, 104 and 144 days, 33%, 32-41% and 52% lower than published estimates of 287, 152-177 and 298 days, respectively, for clade C samples from general populations. Point estimates of MDRI values were 7 - 19% shorter for women who seroconverted in the first 9- months postpartum, compared with those seroconverting later. MDRI values for three HIV incidence biomarkers are longer in the general population than among postpartum women, particularly those who recently gave birth, consistent with heightened immunologic activation soon after birth. Our results provide a caution that MDRI may vary significantly between subjects in different physiological states.",

Results from a UK clinical sample Discrepancies are often found between child and parent reports of child psychopathology, nevertheless the role of the child's presenting difficulties in relation to these is underexplored. This study investigates whether parent-child agreement on the conduct and emotional scales of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) varied as a result of certain child characteristics, including the child's presenting problems to clinical services, age and gender. The UK -based sample consisted of 16,754 clinical records of children aged 11-17, the majority of which were female (57%) and White (76%). The dataset was provided by the Child Outcomes Research Consortium, which collects outcome measures from child services across the UK. Clinicians reported the child's presenting difficulties, and parents and children completed the SDQ. Using correlation analysis, the main findings indicated that agreement varied as a result of the child's difficulties for reports of conduct problems, and this seemed to be related to the presence or absence of externalising difficulties in the child's presentation. This was not the case for reports of emotional difficulties. In addition, agreement was higher when reporting problems not consistent with the child's presentation; for instance, agreement on conduct problems was greater for children presenting with internalising problems. Lastly, the children's age and gender did not seem to have an impact on agreement. These findings demonstrate that certain child presenting difficulties, and in particular conduct problems, may be related to informant agreement and need to be considered in clinical practice and research. Trial Registration This study was observational and as such did not require trial registration.",

Low-level light therapy (LLLT) exhibits positive effects on rehabiliation of degenerative nerves and neural disorders. With this in mind, we postulate that 3D printed neural scaffold coupling with LLLT will generate a new strategy to repair neural degeneration. To achieve this goal, we applied red laser light to stimualte neural stem cells on 3D printed scaffolds and investigated the subsequent cell response with respect to cell proliferation and differentiation. Here we show that cell prolifeartion rate and intracellular reactive oxgen species synthesis were significantly increased after 15 s laser stimulation follwed by 1 d culture. Over culturing time of 14 d in vitro, the laser stimulation promoted neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells, while the glial differentiation was suppressed based on results of both immunocytochemistry studies and real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. These findings suggest that integration of 3D printing and LLLT might provide a powerful methodology for neural tissue engineering.",

While attempts have been made to study cellulose metabolism through the use of knock-out mutants, there have been no systematic effort to characterize natural variation for cellulose metabolism in ecotypes adapted to different habitats. Here, we characterized natural variation in saccharification of cellulose and fermentation in 73 ecotypes and 89 laboratory strains of the model fungus Neurospora crassa. We observed significant variation in both traits among natural and laboratory generated populations, with some elite strains performing better than the reference strain. In the F1 population N345, 15% of the population outperformed both parents with the top performing strain having 10% improvement in ethanol production. These results suggest that natural alleles can be exploited through fungal breeding for developing elite industrial strains for bioethanol production.",

Control animals (N = 25; 67 ± 3.9 kg) received normal saline. OPB reduced mortality in PROP1.0 - OBP45 compared to PROP1.0 (0% vs. 71%). PROP0.5 bis had increased mortality compared to CONTROL (60-% vs. 4%). Administration of beta blockers prior to saturation decompression appears to increase DCS and worsen mortality in a swine model; however, their effects in bounce diving remain unknown.Forbes AS, Regis DP, HallAA, Mahon RT, Cronin WA.

      "document": "Estrogen deficiency accelerates lumbar facet joints arthritis Dramatic increase in the prevalence of lumbar facet joint (LFJ) arthritis in women around the age of menopause indicates a protective role for estrogen in LFJ arthritis. To date, there is no evidence for this indication and the mechanism of such an effect remains poorly understood. In this study, ovariectomized (OVX) mice were used to mimic the estrogen - deficient status of post-menopausal women. Micro-CT and immunohistochemistry was employed to assess the morphological and molecular changes in ovariectomy - induced LFJ arthritis. The results show that the LFJ subchondral bone mass was significantly decreased in OVX mice, with increased cavities on the interface of the subchondral bone. Severe cartilage degradation was observed in ovariectomy - induced LFJ arthritis. Increased blood vessels and innervations were also found in degenerated LFJ, particularly in the subchondral bone area. 17β-Estradiol treatment efficiently suppressed LFJ subchondral bone turnover, markedly inhibited cartilage degradation, and increased blood vessel and nerve ending growth in degenerated LFJ in OVX mice. Our study reveals that estrogen is a key factor in regulating LFJ metabolism. Severe LFJ degeneration occurs when estrogen is absent in vivo. Collapsed subchondral bone may be the initiation of this process, and estrogen replacement therapy can effectively prevent degeneration of LFJ under estrogen - deficient conditions.",

      "document": "Prostaglandin E2 produced following infection with Theiler's virus promotes the pathogenesis of demyelinating disease Infection of various cells with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) activates the TLR - and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5)-dependent pathways, resulting in the production of IL-1β via the activation of caspase-1 upon assembly of the node-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. The role of IL-1β in the pathogenesis of TMEV - induced demyelinating disease was previously investigated. However, the signaling effects of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) downstream of the NLRP3 inflammasome on the immune responses to viral determinants and the pathogenesis of demyelinating disease are unknown. In this study, we investigated the levels of intermediate molecules leading to PGE2 signaling and the effects of blocking PGE2 signaling on the immune response to TMEV infection, viral persistence and the development of demyelinating disease. We demonstrate here that TMEV infection activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and PGE2 signaling much more vigorously in dendritic cells (DCs) and CD11b+ cells from susceptible SJL mice than in cells from resistant B6 mice. Inhibition of virus - induced PGE2 signaling using AH23848 resulted in decreased pathogenesis of demyelinating disease and viral loads in the central nervous system (CNS). In addition, AH23848 treatment caused the elevation of protective early IFN-γ - producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Because the levels of IFN-β were lower in AH23848 - treated mice but the level of IL-6 was similar, over-production of pathogenic IFN-β was modulated and the generation of IFN-γ - producing T cell responses was enhanced by the inhibition of PGE2 signaling. These results strongly suggest that excessive activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and downstream PGE2 signaling contribute to the pathogenesis of TMEV - induced demyelinating disease.",

In these simulations, the - containing DNA duplex exhibits a significantly wider major groove and greater average values of stagger, slide, rise, twist and h-rise than observed for a ' control ' oligonucleotide in which nucleobase pairs are replaced by.

In this study, we tried to evaluate the possibility that DNA and RNA of collagens exist in human sera, and determined whether their serum levels can be useful biomarkers in scleroderma patients. The RNA or DNA of collagens were purified from sera, and detected by polymerase chain reaction or quantitated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Among approximately 18 360 bases of full-length α1(I) collagen DNA, various regions were detected by polymerase chain reaction in human sera. However, α2(I) collagen DNA, α1(I) collagen RNA or α2(I) collagen RNA were not detectable. α1(I) Collagen DNA in sera was quantitative using our method. The levels of serum α1(I) collagen DNA were significantly increased in scleroderma patients compared with healthy control subjects or systemic lupus erythematosus patients. According to the receiver-operator curve analysis, serum α1(I) collagen DNA levels were shown to be effective as a diagnostic marker of scleroderma. Furthermore, when we determined the association of serum α1(I) collagen DNA levels with clinical / laboratory features in scleroderma patients, those with elevated α1(I) collagen DNA levels showed significantly higher prevalence of pitting scars / ulcers. In summary, elevation of serum α1(I) collagen DNA levels in scleroderma patients may be useful as the diagnostic marker, reflecting the presence of vasculopathy. Jou rna",

      "document": "It's not all about moral reasoning: Understanding the content of Moral Case Deliberation Moral Case Deliberation is one form of clinical ethics support described as a facilitator -led collective moral reasoning by healthcare professionals on a concrete moral question connected to their practice. Evaluation research is needed, but, as human interaction is difficult to standardise, there is a need to capture the content beyond moral reasoning. This allows for a better understanding of Moral Case Deliberation, which may contribute to further development of valid outcome criteria and stimulate the normative discussion of what Moral Case Deliberation should contain. To explore and compare the content beyond moral reasoning in the dialogue in Moral Case Deliberation at Swedish workplaces. A mixed-methods approach was applied for analysing audio-recordings of 70 periodic Moral Case Deliberation meetings at 10 Swedish workplaces. Moral Case Deliberation facilitators and various healthcare professions participated, with registered nurses comprising the majority. Ethical considerations: No objection to the study was made by an Ethical Review Board. After oral and written information was provided, consent to be recorded was assumed by virtue of participation. Other than ' moral reasoning ' (median (md): 45% of the spoken time), the Moral Case Deliberations consisted of 'reflections on the psychosocial work environment ' to a varying extent (md: 29%). Additional content comprised 'assumptions about the patient's psychosocial situation ' (md: 6%), 'facts about the patient's situation ' (md: 5%), 'concrete problem-solving ' (md: 6%) and ' process ' (md: 3%). The findings suggest that a restorative function of staff's wellbeing in Moral Case Deliberation is needed, as this might contribute to good patient care. This supports outcome criteria of improved emotional support, which may include relief of moral distress. However, facilitators need a strategy for how to proceed from the participants ' own emotional needs and to develop the use of their emotional knowing to focus on the ethically difficult patient situation.",

Here, we aimed to identify the genetic cause of POI in two affected sisters manifested with primary amenorrhea and partial development of secondary sexual characters with normal range of height of a consanguineous Han Chinese family. Whole exome and Sanger sequencing identified a homozygous donor splice site mutation (NM_012447.2: c.1573+5G>A) in the STAG3 gene. RT-PCR revealed that the mutation causes loss of wild type donor splice site which leads to aberrant splicing of STAG3 mRNA and consecutive formation of STAG3 alternative transcript (p.Leu490Thrfs*10). This is the first report of splice-site mutation of STAG3 gene causes POI in two Han Chinese patients.",

To assist with this, we designed and developed an integrated system connected with electronic medical records in hospitals to ensure delivery of accurate health information. The system -called the Consumer-centered Open Personal Health Record platform -is composed of two services: a portal for users with any disease and a mobile application for users with cleft lip / palate. To assess the benefits of these services, we used a quasi-experimental, pretest-posttest design, assigning participants to the portal (n = 50) and application (n = 52) groups. Both groups showed significantly increased knowledge, both objective (actual knowledge of health information) and subjective (C of health information), after the intervention. Furthermore, while both groups showed higher information needs satisfaction after the intervention, the application group was significantly more satisfied. Knowledge changes were more affected by participant characteristics in the application group. Our results may be due to the application's provision of specific disease information and a personalized treatment plan based on the participant and other users' data. We recommend that services connected with electronic medical records target specific diseases to provide personalized health management to patients in a hospital setting.",

However, the functions of general control nonrepressed-protein 5 (Gcn5), an evolutionarily conserved HAT from yeast to human, in immune regulation remain unappreciated. In this study, we conditionally deleted Gcn5 (encoded by the Kat2a gene) specifically in T lymphocytes by crossing floxed Gcn5 and Lck-Cre mice, and demonstrated that Gcn5 plays important roles in multiple stages of T cell functions including development, clonal expansion, and differentiation. Loss of Gcn5 functions impaired T cell proliferation, IL-2 production, and Th1 / Th17, but not Th2 and regulatory T cell differentiation. Gcn5 is recruited onto the il-2 promoter by interacting with the NFAT in T cells upon TCR stimulation. Interestingly, instead of directly acetylating NFAT, Gcn5 catalyzes histone H3 lysine H9 acetylation to promote IL-2 production. T cell -specific suppression of Gcn5 partially protected mice from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein - induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an experimental model for human multiple sclerosis. Our study reveals previously unknown physiological functions for Gcn5 and a molecular mechanism underlying these functions in regulating T cell immunity. Hence Gcn5 may be an important new target for autoimmune disease therapy.",

      "document": "Personalizing lung cancer risk prediction and imaging follow-up recommendations using the National Lung Screening Trial dataset To demonstrate a data-driven method for personalizing lung cancer risk prediction using a large clinical dataset. An algorithm was used to categorize nodules found in the first screening year of the National Lung Screening Trial as malignant or nonmalignant. Risk of malignancy for nodules was calculated based on size criteria according to the Fleischner Society recommendations from 2005, along with the additional discriminators of pack-years smoking history, sex, and nodule location. Imaging follow-up recommendations were assigned according to Fleischner size category malignancy risk. Nodule size correlated with malignancy risk as predicted by the Fleischner Society recommendations. With the additional discriminators of smoking history, sex, and nodule location, significant risk stratification was observed. For example, men with ≥60 pack-years smoking history and upper lobe nodules measuring >4 and ≤6 mm demonstrated significantly increased risk of malignancy at 12.4% compared to the mean of 3.81% for similarly sized nodules (P < .0001). Based on personalized malignancy risk, 54% of nodules >4 and ≤6 mm were reclassified to longer-term follow-up than recommended by Fleischner. Twenty-seven percent of nodules ≤4 mm were reclassified to shorter-term follow-up. Using available clinical datasets such as the National Lung Screening Trial in conjunction with locally collected datasets can help clinicians provide more personalized malignancy risk prediction s and follow-up recommendations. By incorporating 3 demographic data points, the risk of lung nodule malignancy within the Fleischner categories can be considerably stratified and more personalized follow-up recommendations can be made.",

      "document": "Influence of the different anteromedial portal on femoral tunnel orientation during anatomic ACL reconstruction The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of femoral tunnel orientation, drilled through the accessory anteromedial (AAM) portal or the high AM portal in anatomic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. In 16 cadaver knees, using o'clock method, centers of the ACL femoral footprint were drilled with an 8-mm reamer via an AAM portal (eight knees) or a high AM portal (eight knees). Computed tomography (CT) scans were taken of each knee. Three-dimensional (3D) models were constructed to identify the femoral tunnel orientation and to create femoral tunnel virtual cylinders for measuring tunnel angles and length. In two of the 16 specimens, we observed a posterior femoral cortex blowout (PFCB) when drilling through a high AM portal. When drilled through the high AM portal, the femoral tunnel length was significantly shorter than when using an AAM portal (30.3 ± 3.8 mm and 38.2 ± 3.1 mm, p < 0.001). The femoral tunnel length was significantly shorter in the group with PFCB compared to the group with no PFCB (25.9 ± 0.6 mm and 35.5 ± 4.5 mm, p = 0.011). The axial obliquity of the high AM portal was significantly higher than that of the AAM portal (52.2 ± 5.9° and 43.0 ± 2.3°, p = 0.003). In anatomic ACL reconstruction, a mal-positioned AM portal can cause abnormal tunnel orientation, which may lead to mechanical failure during ACL reconstruction. Therefore, it is important to select accurate AM portal positioning, and possibly using an AAM portal by measuring an accurate position when drilling a femoral tunnel in anatomic ACL reconstruction.",

Here, we report the cloning and functional studies of proline-rich AMPs (PR-AMPs) from the three species of mud crab: Scylla paramamosain, S. serrata, and the swimming crab Portunus pelagicus. The deduced peptides revealed that they contain the putative signal peptides and encode for mature peptides, which contain sequence architecture similar to a 6.5-kDa proline-rich AMP of the shore crab, Carcinus maenas which showed similarity with the bactenecin7. Tissue distribuction analysis indicated that the SpPR-AMP1 was expressed in a wide range of adult tissues, with the highest expression levels in the crab hemocyte. Challenge experiments showed that the levels of SpPR-AMP1 mRNA expression were up-regulated in the hemocyte after peptidoglycan stimulation. To evaluate the biological properties of mature SpPR-AMP1, peptides were chemically synthesized and recombinantly expressed. SpPR-AMP1 showed strong antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive bacteria Micrococcus luteus and Gram-negative bacteria Vibrio harveyi.

      "document": "Binding of DEAD-box helicase Dhh1 to the 5'UTR of ASH1 mRNA represses localized translation of ASH1 in yeast cells Local translation of specific mRNAs is regulated by dynamic changes in their subcellular localization, and these changes are due to complex mechanisms controlling cytoplasmic mRNA transport. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is well suited to studying these mechanisms because many of its transcripts are transported from the mother cell to the budding daughter cell. Here, we investigated the translational control of ASH1 mRNA after transport and localization. We show that although ASH1 transcripts were translated after they reached the bud-tip, some mRNAs were bound by the RNA-binding protein Puf6 and were non-polysomal. We also found that the DEAD-box helicase Dhh1 complexed with the untranslated ASH1 mRNA and Puf6. Loss of Dhh1 affected local translation of ASH1 mRNA and resulted in delocalization of ASH1 transcript in the bud. Forcibly shifting the non-polysomal ASH1 mRNA into polysomes was associated with Dhh1 dissociation. We further demonstrated that Dhh1 is not recruited to ASH1 mRNA co-transcriptionally, suggesting that it could bind to ASH1 mRNA within the cytoplasm. Of note, Dhh1 bound to the 5 UTR of ASH1 mRNA and inhibited its translation in vitro. These results suggest that after localization to the bud tip, a portion of the localized ASH1 mRNA becomes translationally inactive, because of binding of Dhh1 and Puf6 to the 5' and 3' UTRs of ASH1 mRNA.",

      "document": "Multi-hospital occurrence of pan-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae ST147 with an ISEcp1 -directed blaOXA-181 insertion into the mgrB gene in the United Arab Emirates The emergence of pan-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strains is an increasing concern. In the current study we describe a cluster of 9 pan-resistant K. pneumoniae ST147 isolates encountered in 4 patients over nearly one year in 3 hospitals of the United Arab Emirates. The isolates exhibited highly similar genotypes. All produced chromosomally encoded OXA-181 and the majority also produced the NDM-5 carbapenemase. Similarly to the previously described single isolate from the UAE, MS6671, the mgrB was disrupted by a functional, ISEcp1 -driven blaOXA-181 insertion causing resistance to carbapenems. The mutation was successfully complemented with an intact mgrB gene indicating that it was responsible for colistin resistance. blaNDM-5 was located within a resistance island of an approximately 100 kb IncFII plasmid carrying ermB, mph(A), blaTEM-1B, rmtB, blaNDM-5, sul1, aadA2 and dfrA12 resistance genes. Sequencing this plasmid (pABC143-NDM) revealed that its backbone was nearly identical to that of plasmid pMS6671E from which several resistance genes, including blaNDM-5, had been deleted. More extensive similarities of the backbone and the resistance island were found between pABC143C-NDM and the blaNDM-5 carrying IncFII plasmids of two K. pneumoniae ST147 isolates from South Korea, one of which was colistin resistant, and both also produced OXA-181. Notably one of these strains was isolated from a patient transferred from the UAE. Our data show that this pan-resistant clone has an alarming capacity to maintain itself over an extended period of time, and even likely to be transmitted internationally.",

      "document": "In vitro antifungal, probiotic, and antioxidant functional properties of a novel Lactobacillus paraplantarum isolated from fermented dates in Saudi Arabia Fermented foods produced using dates are used in Gulf countries as beneficial and healthful foods. The beneficial microbial flora in fermented dates contributes to maintaining the nutritional properties of dates by preventing the growth of spoilage fungi. Here, we examined the antifungal, probiotic, and antioxidant properties of the novel Lactobacillus strain D-3 isolated from fermented dates. Analyzing the morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics of this strain demonstrated that it was similar to Lactobacillus species, and molecular level amplification of the 16S rRNA gene showed that it belonged to Lactobacillus paraplantarum. Under shake flask cultivation using date juice, the strain produced significant amounts of ethanol and lactic, succinic, and acetic acids. Purification of benzoic acid extracted from the extracellular fermentation medium was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and infrared and mass spectral data revealed minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 10, 20, 10, 5, and 10 mg mL(-1) for Aspergillus fumigates, Curvularia lunata, Fusarium oxysporum, Gibberella moniliformis, and Penicillium chrysogenum, respectively. The strain showed several advantages, including the ability to survive under conditions similar to the gastrointestinal tract (low pH, bile salts, and antimicrobial susceptibility) and high levels of extracellular enzyme activities. The strain's growth patterns under various concentrations of H2 O2 and its scavenging properties towards hydroxyl radical (64.85%) and DPPH (84.97%) were also interesting properties. The antifungal, probiotic, and antioxidant properties of L. paraplantarum D3 may provide health benefits to consumers.",

      "document": "Effectiveness of Intracavitary Electrocardiogram Guidance in Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter Tip Placement in Neonates Correct tip location is crucial for a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) to maximize the effects of central venous infusion. However, it is difficult to place the tip in a correct location in neonates because of the unreliable estimated length by surface landmark. Therefore, we evaluated the feasibility and safety of an improved intracavitary electrocardiogram (IC - ECG) technique in guiding PICC placement in neonates based on the ratios of P/R wave amplitudes on IC - ECG. The results showed that all of the 32 neonates whose PICCs had been successfully placed and correct tip position verified by chest radiography acquired qualified P wave on IC - ECG. The average ratio of P/R wave amplitude was 0.6 ± 0.1, with a range of 0.4 to 0.8. The 49 neonates who received IC - ECG -guided PICC catheterization showed higher success rates of correct PICC tip position on the first attempt than traditional, predetermined length estimation on surface landmark (93.9% vs 62.5%, χ = 18.01, P < .001). No significant complications occurred in the studied neonates. Based on these findings, IC - ECG -guided tip placement appears to be a promising approach in improving the success rate of tip location when placing a PICC in neonates.",

      "document": "Serum levels of genomic DNA of α1(I) collagen are elevated in scleroderma patients Recent studies have indicated that various nucleic acids are present in human sera, and attracted attention for their potential as novel disease markers in many human diseases. In this study, we tried to evaluate the possibility that DNA and RNA of collagens exist in human sera, and determined whether their serum levels can be useful biomarkers in scleroderma patients. The RNA or DNA of collagens were purified from sera, and detected by polymerase chain reaction or quantitated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Among approximately 18 360 bases of full-length α1(I) collagen DNA, various regions were detected by polymerase chain reaction in human sera. However, α2(I) collagen DNA, α1(I) collagen RNA or α2(I) collagen RNA were not detectable. α1(I) Collagen DNA in sera was quantitative using our method. The levels of serum α1(I) collagen DNA were significantly increased in scleroderma patients compared with healthy control subjects or systemic lupus erythematosus patients. According to the receiver-operator curve analysis, serum α1(I) collagen DNA levels were shown to be effective as a diagnostic marker of scleroderma. Furthermore, when we determined the association of serum α1(I) collagen DNA levels with clinical / laboratory features in scleroderma patients, those with elevated α1(I) collagen DNA levels showed significantly higher prevalence of pitting scars / ulcers. In summary, elevation of serum α1(I) collagen DNA levels in scleroderma patients may be useful as the diagnostic marker, reflecting the presence of vasculopathy. Jou rna",

To evaluate the impact of fellows ' involvement on the peri-operative outcomes of robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN). We analysed 216 patients who underwent RAPN for a small renal tumour. We stratified our cohort into two groups according to the involvement of a fellow surgeon during the procedure: expert surgeon operating alone (expert group) and fellow operating under the supervision of the expert surgeon (fellow group). Peri-operative data were compared between the two groups. Linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the impact of fellows ' involvement on peri-operative and postoperative outcomes. Trifecta and margins ischaemia complications (MIC) score achievement rates were used to assess the quality of surgery in both the expert and fellow groups. Trifecta was defined as a combination of warm ischaemia time <25 min, negative surgical margins and no peri-operative complications. MIC score was defined as negative surgical margins, ischaemia time <20 min, and absence of complications grade ≥3. Fellows were involved in a total of 89 procedures (41%). Patients ' characteristics were similar in the two groups. Operating time and warm ischaemia time (WIT) were longer in the fellow group (180 vs 120 min, P < 0.001, and 18 vs 14 min, P = 0.002, respectively). Length of hospital stay (LOS) was longer in the fellow group (5 vs 4.3 days; P = 0.05) and patients in this group had higher estimated blood loss (EBL; 400 vs 300 mL; P = 0.01), but this had no impact on transfusion rate (14% vs 11%; P = 0.43). Positive surgical margin rates were similar in the fellow and expert groups (2.2% vs 3.1%; P = 0.70). Major complications were more frequent in the fellow group (12.3% vs 6.3%), but the difference was not significant (P = 0.10). In multivariable analysis, fellow involvement was predictive of longer WIT (β = 0.22; P = 0.003) and operating time (β = 0.49; P < 0.001), but was not associated with EBL (β = 0.12, P = 0.09) or LOS (β = 0.12, P = 0.11). Finally, fellow involvement was associated with a lower rate of trifecta and MIC score accomplishment (odds ratio [OR] 0.53, P = 0.05 and OR 0.46, P = 0.01, respectively). Training fellows to perform RAPN is associated with longer operating time and WIT but does not appear to compromise other peri-operative outcomes.",

In this study, we combine multiplex PCR, custom designed dual indexing and Miseq sequencing for high throughput SNP - profiling of 457 malaria infections from Guinea-Bissau, at the cost of 10 USD per sample. By amplifying and sequencing 15 genetic fragments, we cover 20 resistance -conferring SNPs occurring in pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, pfdhps, as well as the entire length of pfK13, and the mitochondrial barcode for parasite origin. SNPs of interest were sequenced with an average depth of 2,043 reads, and bases were called for the various SNP - positions with a p-value below 0.05, for 89.8-100% of samples. The SNP data indicates that artemisinin resistance -conferring SNPs in pfK13 are absent from the studied area of Guinea-Bissau, while the pfmdr1 86 N allele is found at a high prevalence. The mitochondrial barcodes are unanimous and accommodate a West African origin of the parasites. With this method, very reliable high throughput surveillance of antimalarial drug resistance becomes more affordable than ever before.",

      "document": "The WW domain of the scaffolding protein IQGAP1 is neither necessary nor sufficient for binding to the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2 Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) scaffold proteins, such as IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1), are promising targets for novel therapies against cancer and other diseases. Such approaches require accurate information about which domains on the scaffold protein bind to the kinases in the MAPK cascade. Results from previous studies have suggested that the WW domain of IQGAP1 binds to the cancer -associated MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2, and that this domain might thus offer a new tool to selectively inhibit MAPK activation in cancer cells. The goal of this work was therefore to critically evaluate which IQGAP1 domains bind to ERK1 / 2. Here, using quantitative in vitro binding assays, we show that the IQ domain of IQGAP1 is both necessary and sufficient for binding to ERK1 and ERK2, as well as to the MAPK kinases MEK1 and MEK2. Furthermore, we show that the WW domain is not required for ERK - IQGAP1 binding, and contributes little or no binding energy to this interaction, challenging previous models of how WW-based peptides might inhibit tumorigenesis. Finally, we show that the ERK2 - IQGAP1 interaction does not require ERK2 phosphorylation or catalytic activity and does not involve known docking recruitment sites on ERK2, and we obtain an estimate of the dissociation constant (Kd) for this interaction of 8 μm These results prompt a re-evaluation of published findings and a refined model of IQGAP scaffolding.",

      "document": "The nitroxyl donor Angeli's salt ameliorates Staphylococcus aureus -induced septic arthritis in mice Septic arthritis is a severe and rapidly debilitating disease associated with severe joint pain, inflammation and oxidative stress. Nitroxyl (HNO) has become a nitrogen oxide of significant interest due to its pharmacological endpoints that are potentially favorable for treating varied diseases. However, whether HNO also serves as a treatment to septic arthritis is currently unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the HNO donor, Angeli's salt (AS), in the outcome of chronic Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)-induced septic arthritis in mice. Daily treatment with AS inhibited mechanical hyperalgesia and inflammation (edema, leukocyte migration, cytokines release and NF-κB activation, and oxidative stress) resulting in reduced disease severity (clinical course, histopathological changes, proteoglycan levels in the joints, and osteoclastogenesis). In addition, AS decreased the number of S. aureus colony forming unities in synovial tissue, enhanced the bactericidal effect of macrophages and inhibited the worsening of systemic inflammatory response (leukocyte counts in the lung and systemic proinflammatory cytokine concentration). Our results suggest for the first time the therapeutic potential of AS in a model of septic arthritis by mechanisms involving microbicidal effects, anti-inflammatory actions and reduction of disease severity.",

      "document": "Predictive position computations mediated by parietal areas: TMS evidence When objects move or the eyes move, the visual system can predict the consequence and generate a percept of the target at its new position. This predictive localization may depend on eye movement control in the frontal eye fields (FEF) and the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and on motion analysis in the medial temporal area (MT). Across two experiments we examined whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over right FEF, right IPS, righ t MT, and a control site, peripheral V1 / V2, diminished participants ' perception of two cases of predictive position perception: trans-saccadic fusion, and the flash grab illusion, both presented in the contralateral visual field. In trans-saccadic fusion trials, participants saccade toward a stimulus that is replaced with another stimulus during the saccade. Frequently, predictive position mechanisms lead to a fused percept of pre - and post - saccade stimuli (Paeye et al., 2017). We found that rTMS to IPS significantly decreased the frequency of perceiving trans-saccadic fusion within the first 10min after stimulation. In the flash grab illusion, a target is flashed on a moving background leading to the percept that the target has shifted in the direction of the motion after the flash (Cavanagh and Anstis, 2013). In the first experiment, the reduction in the flash grab illusion after rTMS to IPS and FEF did not reach significance. In the second experiment, using a stronger version of the flash grab, the illusory shift did decrease significantly after rTMS to IPS although not after rTMS to FEF or to MT. These findings suggest that right IPS contributes to predictive position perception during saccades and motion processing in the contralateral visual field.",

      "document": "PRESENCE OF CITRININ IN GRAINS AND ITS POSSIBLE HEALTH EFFECTS Citrinin is a mycotoxin produced by several species of the genera Aspergillus, Penicillium and Monascus and it occurs mainly in stored grain. Citrinin is generally formed after harvest and occurs mainly in stored grains, it also occurs in other plant products. Often, the co-occurrence with other mycotoxins is observed, especially ochratoxin A, which is usually associated with endemic nephropathy. At the European Union level, systematic monitoring of Citrinin in grains began with the aim of determining its highest permissible amount in food. Thus, far the systematic monitoring of the above mentioned mycotoxin in Croatia is yet to begin. The main goal of this study was to determine the presence of Citrinin in grains sampled in the area of Međimurje, Osijek-Baranja, Vukovar-Srijem and Brod-Posavina County. For the purpose of identification and quantification of citrinin, high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) with fluorescence was used (Calibration curve k > 0.999; Intra assay CV = 2.1%; Inter assay CV = 4.3%; LOQ < 1 μg/kg). From the area of Međimurje County, 10 samples of corn and 10 samples of wheat were analyzed. None of the samples contained Citrinin (<1 μg/kg). From the area of Osijek-Baranja and Vukovar-Srijem County, 15 samples from each County were analyzed. The mean value for the samples of Osijek-Baranja County was 19.63 μg/kg (median =15.8 μg/kg), while for Vukovar-Srijem County the mean value of citrinin was 14,6 μg/kg (median =1.23 μg/kg). From 5 analyzed samples from Brod-Posavina County, one of the samples contained citrinin in the amount of 23.8 μg/kg, while the registered amount s in the other samples were <1 μg/kg. The results show that grains from several Counties contain certain amounts of Citrinin possibly indicating a significant intake of citrinin in humans. It must be stated that grains and grain-based products are the basis of everyday diet of all age groups, especially small children, where higher intake of citrinin can occur. Consequently, we emphasize the need for systematic analysis of larger amount of samples, from both large grains and small grains, especially in the area of Brod-Posavina County, in order to obtain more realistic notion of citrinin contamination of grains and to asses the health risk in humans.",

      "document": "A role for the locus coeruleus in the analgesic efficacy of N-acetylaspartylglutamate peptidase (GCPII) inhibitors ZJ43 and 2-PMPA N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) is the third most prevalent and widely distributed neurotransmitter in the mammalian nervous system. NAAG activates a group II metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR3) and is inactivated by an extracellular enzyme, glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) in vivo. Inhibitors of this enzyme are analgesic in animal models of inflammatory, neuropathic and bone cancer pain. NAAG and GCPII are present in the locus coeruleus, a center for the descending noradrenergic inhibitory pain system. In the formalin footpad model, systemic treatment with GCPII inhibitors reduces both phases of the inflammatory pain response and increases release of spinal noradrenaline. This analgesic efficacy is blocked by systemic injection of a group II mGluR antagonist, by intrathecal (spinal) injection of an alpha 2 adrenergic receptor antagonist and by microinjection of an α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist directly into the contralateral locus coeruleus. Footpad inflammation increases release of glutamate in the contralateral locus coeruleu s and systemic treatment with a GCPII inhibitor blocks this increase. Direct injection of GCPII inhibitors into the contralateral or ipsilatera l locus coeruleus reduces both phases of the inflammatory pain response in a dose-dependent manner and the contralateral effect also is blocked by intrathecal injection of an alpha 2 adrenergic receptor antagonist. These data support the hypothesis that the analgesic efficacy of systemically administered GCPII inhibitors is mediated, at least in part, by the contralatera l locus coeruleus via group II mGluR, AMPA and alpha 2 adrenergic receptors.",

In experiment 1, SVC were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS (Control) and treated with 300 µM oleic acid (OLA) + FBS, linoleic acid (LNA) + FBS, palmitic acid (PAM) + FBS, or stearic acid (STA) + FBS for 48 h.

Adipogenesis was determined using Oil Red O staining and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity. The proportion of OLA, PAM, or STA was increased (P < 0.05) in SVC grown in either FBS or CS with OLA, PAM or STA. Adipogenesis was induced in FBS + OLA, FBS + LNA, FBS + PAM, FBS + STA, CS + OLA, CS + LNA, CS + PAM, or CS + STA compared to FBS. GPDH activity was significantly higher in FBS + OLA and FBS + LNA than one in FBS. Compared to FBS, the expression of FABP4 mRNA increased (P < 0.05) in FBS + OLA, FBS + LNA, or FBS + PAM, whereas that of C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and ATGL increased (P < 0.05) in FBS + OLA or FBS + LNA cells. Expression of FABP4 and C/EBPβ mRNA was higher in CS, CS + OLA, CS + LNA, CS + PAM, or CS + STA compared with (FBS, whereas the expression of ATGL and C/EBPα was higher in CS, CS + OLA, or CS + LNA than FBS cells. In conclusion, these results showed that FA have different potentials to induce adipogenesis, LNA is the most potent among the tested FA, and these potentials can be improved in the presence of CS.",

      "document": "Identification of a novel PSEN1 mutation (Leu232Pro) in a Korean patient with early-onset Alzheimer's disease and a family history of dementia In the present study, a novel mutation in exon 7 of presenilin 1 (Leu232Pro) was discovered in a Korean patient with early-onset Alzheimer's disease, who represented memory decline at 37 years of age, followed by impairment in spatial activity and concentrations and personality changes. Imaging analyses with magnetic resonance scan showed diffuse atrophy in the frontoparietal regions. Targeted next generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing identified a heterozygous T to C transition at position 695 (c.695T>C) of in presenilin 1 gene (PSEN1), resulting in a novel missense mutation at codon 232 from leucine to proline (L232P). Several family members of the patient developed dementia, suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance; however, we were unable to perform a segregation analysis to confirm this. Since the proline may play a role as a helix breaker, this mutation could significantly disturb the transmembrane helix domain-V of PSEN1 and perturb its protein functions. This hypothesis was supported by the results from the in silico analyses, predicted a major kink on this helix. Several leucine > proline substitutions in other PSEN1 transmembrane helices revealed aggressive AD phenotypes. Future functional studies would be needed to evaluate the pathogenicity of this mutation in AD.",

Five elderly, low-active transfemoral amputees who were fitted with a standard non-microprocessor controlled knee prosthesis (NMPK) performed a baseline measurement consisting of a 3 D gait analysis, functional tests and questionnaires. The first follow-up consisted of the same test procedure and was performed with the MPK after 4 to 6 weeks of familiarization. After being refitted to their standard NMPK again, the subjects undertook the second follow-up which consisted of solely questionnaires 4 weeks later. Questionnaires and functional tests showed an increase in the perception of safety. Moreover, gait analysis revealed more physiologic knee and hip extension/flexion patterns when using the MPK. Our results showed that although the Genium with Cenior-Leg ruleset-MPK (GCL-MPK) might help to improve several safety -related outcomes as well as gait biomechanics the functional potential of the GCL-MPK may have been limited without specific training and a sufficient acclimation period. Implications for Rehabilitation Elderly transfemoral amputees are often limited in their activity by safety issues as well as insufficient functioning regarding the non microprocessor -controlled knee prostheses (NMPK), thing that could be eliminated with the use of suitable microprocessor -controlled prostheses (MPK). The safety and functioning of a prototype MPK (GCL-MPK) specifically designed for the needs of older and low-active transfemoral amputees was assessed in this pilot study. The GCL-MPK showed indicators of increased safety and more natural walking patterns in older and low-active transfemoral amputees in comparison to the standard NMPK already after a short acclimatisation time and no structured physical therapy. Regarding functional performance it seems as if providing older and low-active transfemoral amputees with the GCL-MPK alone without prescribing structured prosthesis training might be insufficient to achieve improvements over the standard NMPKs.",

Understanding key molecular factors involved in vascular degeneration and repair is paramount for developing effective diabetic retinopathy treatment strategies. We propose that diabetes - induced activation of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) plays essential role in retinal endothelial and CD34(+) circulating angiogenic cell (CAC) dysfunction in diabetes. Human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) isolated from control and diabetic donor tissue and human CD34(+) CACs from control and diabetic patients were used in this study. ASM messenger RNA and protein expression were assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. To evaluate the effect of diabetes - induced ASM on HRECs and CD34(+) CACs function, tube formation, CAC incorporation into endothelial tubes, and diurnal release of CD34(+) CACs in diabetic individuals were determined. ASM expression level was significantly increased in HRECs isolated from diabetic compared with control donor tissue, as well as CD34(+) CACs and plasma of diabetic patients. A significant decrease in tube area was observed in HRECs from diabetic donors compared with control HRECs. The tube formation deficiency was associated with increased expression of ASM in diabetic HRECs. Moreover, diabetic CD34(+) CACs with high ASM showed defective incorporation into endothelial tubes. Diurnal release of CD34(+) CACs was disrupted with the rhythmicity lost in diabetic patients. Collectively, these findings support that diabetes - induced ASM upregulation has a marked detrimental effect on both retinal endothelial cells and CACs.",

      "document": "Genetic Diversity in Various Accessions of Pineapple [Ananas comosus (L.) Merr.] Using ISSR and SSR Markers Inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to assess the genetic diversity of 36 pineapple accessions that were introduced from 10 countries / regions. Thirteen ISSR primers amplified 96 bands, of which 91 (93.65%) were polymorphic, whereas 20 SSR primers amplified 73 bands, of which 70 (96.50%) were polymorphic. Nei's gene diversity (h = 0.28), Shannon's information index (I = 0.43), and polymorphism information content (PIC = 0.29) generated using the SSR primers were higher than that with ISSR primers (h = 0.23, I = 0.37, PIC = 0.24), thereby suggesting that the SSR system is more efficient than the ISSR system in assessing genetic diversity in various pineapple accessions. Mean genetic similarities were 0.74, 0.61, and 0.69, as determined using ISSR, SSR, and combined ISSR / SSR, respectively. These results suggest that the genetic diversity among pineapple accessions is very high. We clustered the 36 pineapple accessions into three or five groups on the basis of the phylogenetic trees constructed based on the results of ISSR, SSR, and combined ISSR / SSR analyses using the unweighted pair-group with arithmetic averaging (UPGMA) method. The results of principal components analysis (PCA) also supported the UPGMA clustering. These results will be useful not only for the scientific conservation and management of pineapple germplasm but also for the improvement of the current pineapple breeding strategies.",

Design / methodology /approach Qualitative interview study analysed using directed and conventional content analyses. Participants were 38 individuals with experience of commissioning, delivering or using alcohol healthcare services in Southwark, Lambeth and Lewisham. Findings QS11 implementation ranged from no implementation to full implementation across the 13 statements. Implementation quality was also reported to vary widely across different settings. The analyses also uncovered numerous barriers and facilitators to implementing each statement. Overarching barriers to implementation included: inherent differences between specialist vs generalist settings; poor communication between healthcare settings; generic barriers to implementation; and poor governance structures and leadership. Research limitations /implications QS11 was created to summarise alcohol-related NICE guidance. The aim was to simplify guidance and enhance local implementation. However, in practice the standard requires complex actions by professionals. There was considerable variation in local alcohol commissioning models, which was associated with variation in implementation. These models warrant further evaluation to identify best practice. Originality/value Little evidence exists on the implementing quality standards, as distinct from clinical practice guidelines. The authors present direct evidence on quality standard implementation, identify implementation shortcomings and make recommendations for future research and practice.",

      "document": "Correcting Concavity of Rabbit Auricular Cartilage: Comparison of Single Scoring Incisions with Butyl Cyanoacrylate -Aided Techniques The authors present the results of an experimental study in which four different techniques were used for the correction of concave rabbit auricular cartilage. Sixteen New Zealand adult male rabbits were used in the study. Butyl cyanoacrylate -aided cartilage graft fixation and butyl cyanoacrylate -aided bone graft fixation and scoring technique, alone or combined with butyl cyanoacrylate application, were performed to correct the concavity of rabbit auricular cartilage. Angle measurements showed that all four techniques were efficient for correction of the cartilage concavities. However, the mean postsacrifice angles of the graft fixation groups were significantly higher than those of the other study groups, reflecting the fact that graft fixation with butyl cyanoacrylate application was more efficient for preserving the final cartilage shape. Furthermore, in the ninth month, graft fixation groups had the lowest chondrocyte densities, the highest degree of inflammation, the highest degree of foreign body reaction, and the highest butyl cyanoacrylate density. Fibrosis or chondrocyte proliferation on scoring incision lines is not an associated feature of this technique. When the incision depths were standardized, the scoring technique provided efficacy similar to that of the scoring incisions combined with butyl cyanoacrylate application for correction of the cartilage concavity. The scoring incision plus butyl cyanoacrylate group showed less toxicity than the graft fixation groups because of rapid removal of toxic breakdown products. Graft fixation techniques were superior to other corrective procedures with regard to preservation of the final cartilage shape. Although they resulted in greater toxicity, the cartilage correction was not affected unfavorably.",

      "document": "Galectin-3 is a target for proteases involved in the virulence of Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of skin and soft-tissue infection. The bacterium expresses four major proteases emerging as virulence factors; aureolysin (Aur), V8 protease (SspA), staphopain A (ScpA), and staphopain B (SspB). We hypothesized that human galectin-3, a β-galactoside-binding lectin involved in immune regulation and antimicrobial defense, is a target for these proteases, and that proteolysis of galectin-3 is a novel immune evasion mechanism. Indeed, supernatants from laboratory strains and clinical isolates of S. aureus caused galectin-3 degradation. Similar proteolytic capacity was found in Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates, but not Staphylococcus saprophyticus Galectin-3 -induced activation of the neutrophil NADPH-oxidase was abrogated by bacteria -derived proteolysis of galectin-3, and SspB was identified as the major protease responsible. The impact of galectin-3 and protease expression on S. aureus virulence was studied in a murine skin infection model. In galectin-3(+/+) mice, SspB - expressing S. aureus caused larger lesions and higher bacterial load than protease-lacking bacteria. No such difference was detected in galectin-3(-/-) mice, which also showed smaller lesion size as compared to the galectin-3(+/+) animals. In conclusion, the staphylococcal protease SspB inactivates galectin-3, abrogating its stimulation of oxygen radical production in human neutrophils and increasing tissue damage during skin infection.",

      "document": "Artificial spatiotemporal touch inputs reveal complementary decoding in neocortical neurons Investigations of the mechanisms of touch perception and decoding has been hampered by difficulties in achieving invariant patterns of skin sensor activation. To obtain reproducible spatiotemporal patterns of activation of sensory afferents, we used an artificial fingertip equipped with an array of neuromorphic sensors. The artificial fingertip was used to transduce real-world haptic stimuli into spatiotemporal patterns of spikes. These spike patterns were delivered to the skin afferents of the second digit of rats via an array of stimulation electrodes. Combined with low - noise intra - and extracellular recordings from neocortical neurons in vivo, this approach provided a previously inaccessible high resolution analysis of the representation of tactile information in the neocortical neuronal circuitry. The results indicate high information content in individual neurons and reveal multiple novel neuronal tactile coding features such as heterogeneous and complementary spatiotemporal input selectivity also between neighboring neurons. Such neuronal heterogeneity and complementariness can potentially support a very high decoding capacity in a limited population of neurons. Our results also indicate a potential neuroprosthetic approach to communicate with the brain at a very high resolution and provide a potential novel solution for evaluating the degree or state of neurological disease in animal models.",

The present study aimed to explore the protective factors against cognitive decline among community-dwelling middle-aged and older people from health, social, and lifestyle perspectives. Data of the Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study, a population -based cohort study in Taiwan, were retrieved for the study. Overall, 676 participants with intact baseline cognitive function (measured by the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire) were enrolled and followed for six years. Any increasing score of the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire in the observational period was referred to as cognitive function decline. Associated factors for cognitive decline were identified by the logistic regression model. Among all participants, 205 (30%) experienced cognitive decline during the study period. Crude logistic regression showed that women (odds ratio [OR] 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-2.6), low educational level (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.4-3.0) and low mastery (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0-1.9) were associated with cognitive decline, but no daily consumption of vegetables and fruits had only a marginal association (OR 1.3, 95% CI 0.9-1.8). In the fully adjusted logistic regression analysis, old age, women, low educational level and low sense of mastery were independent predictors for cognitive decline. Participants with two modifiable factors (mastery, and daily consumptions of vegetables and fruits) had a lower risk of cognitive decline (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.9), compared with those without any protective factor. Participants with a better educational level, better personal mastery, and more consumption of fruits and vegetables were less likely to experience cognitive decline. An intervention study combining these features should be carried out to promote better cognitive health in communities. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2017: 17 (Suppl. 1): 20-27.",

Luminex assay of plasma cytokines and growth factors delineated a distinct biosignature in comorbid TBDM in this cohort. Transcriptional profiling revealed elements in common with published TB signatures from cohorts that excluded DM. Neutrophil count correlated with the molecular degree of perturbation, especially in TBDM patients. Body mass index and HDL cholesterol were negatively correlated with molecular degree of perturbation. Diabetic complication pathways including several pathways linked to epigenetic reprogramming were activated in TBDM above levels observed with DM alone.

Based on a field experiment, the shifts in soil microbial metabolic activities and community structures under five irrigation salinities were studied using Biolog and metagenomic methods in this study. The results demonstrated that microbial metabolic activities were greatly restrained in saline water irrigated soils, as average well color development (AWCD) reduced under all saline water irrigation treatments. Although no significant difference in carbon substrate utilization of all six categories was observed among Mild, Medium, High and Severe treatments, the consumption of sole carbon source was significantly varied. Especially, asparagine, galacturonic, putrescine and 4-benzoic acid played a decisive role in dominating the differences. Soil bacterial richness and diversity increased with irrigation salinity while the number of bacterial phyla decreased. Three significantly increased (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi), two decreased (Planctomycetes, Bacteroidetes) and two irresponsive (Gemmatimonadetes and Acidobacteria) phyla were observed as the dominant groups in saline water irrigated soils.

Farnesylthiosalicylic acid -loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-1,2 distearoyl-glycerol-3-phospho-ethanolamine-N [methoxy (PEG)-2000] ammonium salt (PLGA-DSPE-PEG) with or without 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) hybrid nanoparticles has been prepared and evaluated for in-vitro characterization. Cytotoxicity of FTA-loaded nanoparticles along with its efficacy on rat glioma-2 (RG2) cells was also evaluated both in vitro (in comparison with non-malignant cell line, L929) and in vivo. Scanning electron microscopy studies showed that all formulations prepared had smooth surface and spherical in shape. FTA and FTA-loaded nanoparticles have cytotoxic activity against RG2 glioma cell lines in cell culture studies, which further increases with addition of DOTAP. Magnetic resonance imaging and histopathologic evaluation on RG2 tumour cells in rat glioma model (49 female Wistar rats, 250-300 g) comparing intravenous and intratumoral injections of the drug have been performed and FTA-loaded nanoparticles reduced tumour size significantly in in-vivo studies, with higher efficiency of intratumoral administration than intravenous route. Farnesylthiosalicylic acid -loaded PLGA-DSPE-PEG-DOTAP hybrid nanoparticles are proven to be effective against glioblastoma in both in-vitro and in-vivo experiments.",

      "document": "Interplant Aboveground Signaling Prompts Upregulation of Auxin Promoter and Malate Transporter as Part of Defensive Response in the Neighboring Plants When disrupted by stimuli such as herbivory, pathogenic infection, or mechanical wounding, plants secrete signals such as root exudates and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The emission of VOCs induces a response in the neighboring plant communities and can improve plant fitness by alerting nearby plants of an impending threat and prompting them to alter their physiology for defensive purposes. In this study, we investigated the role of plant -derived signals, released as a result of mechanical wounding, that may play a role in intraspecific communication between Arabidopsis thaliana communities. Plant -derived signals released by the wounded plant resulted in more elaborate root development in the neighboring, unwounded plants. Such plant -derived signals also upregulated the Aluminum-activated malate transporter (ALMT1) responsible for the secretion of malic acid (MA) and the DR5 promoter, an auxin responsive promoter concentrated in root apex of the neighboring plants. We speculate that plant -derived signal - induced upregulation of root -specific ALMT1 in the undamaged neighboring plants sharing the environment with stressed plants may associate more with the benign microbes belowground. We also observed increased association of beneficial bacterium Bacillus subtilis UD1022 on roots of the neighboring plants sharing environment with the damaged plants. Wounding-induced plant -derived signals therefore induce defense mechanisms in the undamaged, local plants, eliciting a two-pronged preemptive response of more rapid root growth and up-regulation of ALMT1, resulting in increased association with beneficial microbiome.",

The prevalence of anemia (hemoglobin ≤130g/L males, ≤120g/L females) was determined in each sample. In FDS2, associates of anemia were assessed using multiple logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards modeling identified predictors of death during 4.3±1.2years post-recruitment. The prevalence of anemia at baseline was 11.5% in FDS2 participants, 17.8% in BDS type 2 patients and 5.4% in BDS participants without diabetes.

We determined the association of different clinical, CSF and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters with prevalence and severity of fatigue, as measured by the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions in 68 early MS patients (discovery cohort). We validated our findings in two MS cohorts: the MRI validation cohort (N = 233) for the clinical and MRI parameters, and the CSF validation cohort (N = 81) for the clinical and CSF parameters. Fatigue was associated with clinical disability. Fatigue did not correlate with any CSF parameter but correlated negatively with total and cortical grey matter volume. However, when controlling for Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) in a multivariate model, these associations lost significance. Disability and disease duration best explain fatigue severity but none of the tested MRI or CSF parameter was reliably associated with fatigue.",

      "document": "Long-Range Interactions in Riboswitch Control of Gene Expression Riboswitches are widespread RNA motifs that regulate gene expression in response to fluctuating metabolite concentrations. Known primarily from bacteria, riboswitches couple specific ligand binding and changes in RNA structure to mRNA expression in cis. Crystal structures of the ligand binding domains of most of the phylogenetically widespread classes of riboswitches, each specific to a particular metabolite or ion, are now available. Thus, the bound states -one end point -have been thoroughly characterized, but the unbound states have been more elusive. Consequently, it is less clear how the unbound, sensing riboswitch refolds into the ligand binding - induced output state. The ligand recognition mechanisms of riboswitches are diverse, but we find that they share a common structural strategy in positioning their binding sites at the point of the RNA three-dimensional fold where the residues farthest from one another in sequence meet. We review how riboswitch folds adhere to this fundamental strategy and propose future research directions for understanding and harnessing their ability to specifically control gene expression.",

Methods: A single- center, retrospective cohort study to determine incidence and diagnostic accuracy for Type 2 DN as the primary cause of ESRD (Code 250.40) on the Center for Medicare & Medicaid (CMS) Medical Evidence Report form (CMS2728) submitted at renal replacement therapy initiation. All patients ≥18 years of age with a CMS2728 submitted between 1 March 2006 and 31 March 2015 at a single academic military medical center (ESRD Network 5) were included. Medical records of those with a Code 250.40 diagnosis were reviewed to determine whether they met the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) 2007 criteria for DN. Results: ESRD incidence secondary to Type 2 DN was 18.7% (56/299 individual CMS2728 submissions over 9.09 years). In all, 12/56 (21.4%) did not meet KDOQI criteria for Type 2 DN. Although all had diabetes, those not meeting criteria had shorter disease duration (P = 0.007), were more likely to have active urine sediment (P = 0.006), and were less likely to have macroalbuminuria (P = 0.037) or retinopathy (P = 0.002) prior to ESRD. On exact logistic regression, retinopathy was significantly associated with KDOQI -predicted DN [odds ratio = 19.16 (confidence interval 2.76-223.7), P = 0.0009]. Conclusions: In this single- center cohort, 21.4% identified as having Type 2 DN as the primary cause of ESRD were incorrectly assigned per KDOQI 2007 clinical criteria. If replicated in larger populations, this could have substantial implications regarding the epidemiology of ESRD in the USA.",

The mechanism involved in the generation of elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) is not fully illustrated. Here we show that NADPH oxidase activation is closely related to heavy ion radiation - induced cell death via excessive ROS generation. Cell death and cellular ROS can be greatly reduced in irradiated cancer cells with the preincubation of diphenyleneiodium, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase. Most of the NADPH oxidase (NOX) family proteins (NOX1, NOX2, NOX3, NOX4, and NOX5) showed increased expression after heavy ion irradiation. Meanwhile, the cytoplasmic subunit p47(phox) was translocated to the cell membrane and localized with NOX2 to form reactive NADPH oxidase. Our data suggest for the first time that ROS generation, as mediated by NADPH oxidase activation, could be an important contributor to heavy ion irradiation - induced cell death.",

Twelve- week -old male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups (n = 5 each): a normal occlusion (C) group, an occlusal hypofunction (H) group, and an occlusal hypofunction group subjected to LIPUS (HL) treatment. Hypofunctional occlusion of the maxillary first molar (M1) of the H and HL groups was induced by the bite-raising technique. Only the HL group was irradiated with LIPUS for 5 days. The IRAB and PDL of M1 were examined by microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) analysis. To quantify mRNA expression of cytokines involved in PDL proliferation and development, real-time reverse transcription quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed for twist family bHLH transcription factor 1 (Twist1), periostin, and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in the PDL samples. Micro-CT analysis showed that the PDL volume was decreased in the H group compared with that of the C and HL groups. Both bone volume per tissue volume (BV / TV) of IRAB was decreased in the H group compared with that in the C group. LIPUS exposure restored BV / TV in the IRAB of the HL group. qRT-PCR analysis showed that Twist1, periostin, and CTGF mRNA levels were decreased in the H group and increased in the HL group. LIPUS exposure reduced the atrophic changes of alveolar bone by inducing the upregulation of periostin and CTGF expression to promote PDL healing after induction of occlusal hypofunction.",

Normally, superoxide dismutase (SOD) converts superoxide anions to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and H2O2 is then naturalized to be water by peroxiredoxin 4. We reported previously that recombinant protein transduction domain (PTD)- Cu/Zn SOD effectively scavenged excessive ROS and prevented cardiomyocytes from hypoxia-reoxygenation damage. However, whether PTD - Cu/Zn SOD would prevent BCP development is unknown. In the current study, we found that an implanted carcinoma in the rat tibia induced remarkable hyperalgesia, increased H2O2 levels and decreased SOD and peroxiredoxin 4 levels. After administration of recombinant PTD - Cu/Zn SOD to these tumor-burden rats, their hyperalgesia was significantly attenuated and peroxiredoxin 4 expression was significantly increased. In addition, an increased expression of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors and a decreased expression of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in this cancer pain were prevented by PTD - Cu/Zn SOD administration or peroxiredoxin 4 overexpression. Our data suggested that reactive oxygen species, at least in part, play a role in cancer metastatic pain development and persistency which can be attenuated by the adminstration of recombinant PTD - Cu/Zn SOD via the peroxiredoxin 4 modulation from oxidative stress.",

      "document": "A Conserved Role for VEGF Signaling in Specification of Homologous Mesenchymal Cell Types Positioned at Spatially Distinct Developmental Addresses in Early Development of Sea Urchins Comparative studies of early development in echinoderms are revealing the tempo and mode of alterations to developmental gene regulatory networks and to the cell types they specify. In euechinoid sea urchins, skeletogenic mesenchyme (SM) ingresses prior to gastrulation at the vegetal pole and aligns into a ring-like array with two bilateral pockets of cells, the sites where spiculogenesis will later occur. In cidaroid sea urchins, the anciently diverged sister clade to euechinoid sea urchins, a homologous SM cell type ingresses later in development, after gastrulation has commenced, and consequently at a distinct developmental address. Thus, a heterochronic shift of ingression of the SM cell type occurred in one of the echinoid lineages. In euechinoids, specification and migration of SM are facilitated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling. We describe spatiotemporal expression of vegf and vegfr and experimental manipulations targeting VEGF signaling in the cidaroid Eucidaris tribuloides. Spatially, vegf and vegfr mRNA localizes similarly as in euechinoids, suggesting conserved deployment in echinoids despite their spatially distinct development addresses of ingression. Inhibition of VEGF signaling in E. tribuloides suggests its role in SM specification is conserved in echinoids. Temporal discrepancies between the onset of vegf expression and SM ingression likely result in previous observations of SM \"random wandering\" behavior. Our results indicate that, although the SM cell type in echinoids ingresses into distinct developmental landscapes, it retains a signaling mechanism that restricts their spatial localization to a conserved developmental address where spiculogenesis later occurs.",

A database search was performed to identify relevant studies published between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 2014. Thirteen publications, including 11 studies, met all inclusion and exclusion criteria. All studies included grandparent mental health outcomes with fewer focusing on physical health and social relations. Improvements were found in all three areas with fewer improvements seen in physical health. However, small effect sizes were seen with most measures of these outcomes. Although the interventions led to positive grandparent caregiver outcomes, the studies were limited by their design, only one of which was a randomized controlled trial. Also, interventions did not consider variations in the grandchild's or parent's ages or if the grandparent provided primary or shared care. These gaps should be addressed in future research.",

Stretching red blood cells using optical tweezers is a way to characterize the mechanical properties of their membrane by measuring the size of the cell in the direction of the stretching (axial diameter) and perpendicularly (transverse diameter). Recently, such data have been used in numerous publications to validate solvers dedicated to the computation of red blood cell dynamics under flow. In the present study, different mechanical models are used to simulate the stretching of red blood cells by optical tweezers. Results first show that the mechanical moduli of the membranes have to be adjusted as a function of the model used. In addition, by assessing the area dilation of the cells, the axial and transverse diameters measured in optical tweezers experiments are found to be insufficient to discriminate between models relevant to red blood cells or not. At last, it is shown that other quantities such as the height or the profile of the cell should be preferred for validation purposes since they are more sensitive to the membrane model.",

The aim of this translational study was to investigate the effect of long-term eplerenone administration on renal allograft function in children with biopsy -proven chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN). Renal transplant children <18 years, biopsy -proven CAN, and a GFR >40 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) were included. Patients with BK virus active nephritis, recurrence of renal disease, GFR decline in previous 3 months, or treated with calcium antagonists or antifungal drugs were excluded. They were randomized to receive placebo (n=10) or eplerenone 25 mg/d for 24 months (n=13). Visits were scheduled at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months. At each period, a complete clinical examination was performed and blood and urine samples were taken. Urine creatinine, 8-hydroxylated-guanosine, heat shock protein 72 (HSP72), and kidney injury molecule (KIM-1) levels were also assessed. In kidney biopsy samples, the tubulo-interstitial area affected by fibrosis (TIF) and glomerulosclerosis were measured at baseline and after 24 months. The baseline eGFR was 80±6 in the placebo and 86±6 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) in the eplerenone group; at 24 months it was 66±8 and 81±7 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), respectively (P=0.33; 95% confidence intervals, -18 to 33 at baseline, and -11 to 40 after 24 months). The albumin-to-creatinine ratio was 110±74 in the placebo, and 265±140 mg/g in the eplerenone group; and after 24 months it was 276±140 and 228±88 mg/g, respectively (P=0.15; 95% confidence intervals, -283 to 593, and -485 to 391, respectively). In addition, the placebo exhibited a greater TIF, glomerulosclerosis, and urinary HSP72 compared with the eplerenone group. Although this study was underpowered to provide definitive evidence that long-term eplerenone administration attenuates the progression of CAN in pediatric transplant patients, it encourages testing the potential benefit of MRB in this pediatric population.",

      "document": "The impact of childhood maltreatment on the differential efficacy of CBASP versus escitalopram in patients with chronic depression: A secondary analysis Childhood maltreatment (CM) has been indicated as a predictor of a differential response to antidepressant treatment with psychotherapy compared to medication. In this secondary analysis, we investigated whether the presence of CM results in a differential indication for the Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP) or escitalopram plus clinical management (ESC). Sixty patients with chronic depression were randomized to either 22 sessions of CBASP or ESC over the course of 8 weeks of acute and 20 weeks of extended treatment at 2 German treatment sites. CM was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and the clinician rated Early Trauma Inventory. Intention-to-treat analyses were used to examine the impact of CM on depression, global functioning, and quality of life. The presence of CM did not result in significant differences in treatment response to CBASP or ESC on any outcome measure after 28 weeks of treatment independent of the type of CM assessment. After 8 weeks, a significant CM × treatment interaction was found for scores on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Patients with a history of CM receiving CBASP had a significantly lower response rate compared to patients without CM and to those receiving ESC after 8 weeks. Conclusively, CBASP and ESC are equally effective treatment options for the difficult to treat subgroup of patients with chronic depression and a history of CM. CM may be a predictor of a longer latency of treatment response in the case of psychotherapy. CBASP and escitalopram are equally effective treatment options for chronic depression. Both treatments are also equally effective for the difficult to treat subgroup of patients with chronic depression and a history of childhood maltreatment. Childhood maltreatment may result in a longer latency of treatment response in the case of psychotherapy.",

The median age at diagnosis was 16.9 years (range 4.5-41.4). Localized disease was diagnosed in 61.5% of the patients and 38.5% had distant metastases at time of primary diagnosis. The median follow-up time was 3.7 years (range 0.5-9.5). Patients with localized disease showed a 3-year event-free survival (EFS) of 68%, compared to 3-year EFS of 20% in patients with metastases (P = 0.042). Three-year EFS for patients with sarcoma NOS was 52%, patients with localized and metastatic disease showed 3-year EFS of 66 and 20%, respectively. EFS in patients with other diagnoses than Ewing sarcoma treated according to EE99 was significantly higher in patients with localized than metastatic disease. Sarcomas of soft tissue and bone that cannot be classified to current diagnostic categories constitute a therapeutic challenge.",

In continuation of the Porto criteria, we aimed to derive and validate criteria for standardizing the classification of the IBD subtypes. This was a multicenter retrospective longitudinal study from 23 centers affiliated with the Porto-group of ESPGHAN. Both a hypothesis-driven judgmental approach and mathematical CART modeling were utilized for creating a diagnostic algorithm. Since small bowel inflammation is easily recognized as CD, we focused here primarily on the phenotype of colitis. 749 IBD children were enrolled- 236 (32%) Crohn's colitis, 272 (36%) UC and 241 (32%(IBDU (age 10.9±3.6 years) with a median follow-up of 2.8 years (IQR 1.7-4.3). A total of 23 features were clustered in 3 classes according to their prevalence in UC: 6 class-1 (0% prevalence in UC), 12 class-2 (<5% prevalence) and 5 class-3 (5-10% prevalence). According to the algorithm, the disease should be classified as UC if no features exist in any of the classes. When at least one feature exist, different combinations classify the disease into atypical UC, IBDU and CD. The algorithm differentiated UC from CD and IBDU with 80% sensitivity (95% CI 71-88%) and 84% specificity (77-89%), and CD from IBDU and UC with 78% sensitivity (67-87%) and 94% specificity (89-97%).

      "document": "Skin Conductance Responses and Neural Activations During Fear Conditioning and Extinction Recall Across Anxiety Disorders The fear conditioning and extinction neurocircuitry has been extensively studied in healthy and clinical populations, with a particular focus on posttraumatic stress disorder. Despite significant overlap of symptoms between posttraumatic stress disorder and anxiety disorders, the latter has received less attention. Given that dysregulated fear levels characterize anxiety disorders, examining the neural correlates of fear and extinction learning may shed light on the pathogenesis of underlying anxiety disorders. To investigate the psychophysiological and neural correlates of fear conditioning and extinction recall in anxiety disorders and to document how these features differ as a function of multiple diagnoses or anxiety severity. This investigation was a cross-sectional, case-control, functional magnetic resonance imaging study at an academic medical center. Participants were healthy controls and individuals with at least 1 of the following anxiety disorders: generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, and panic disorder. The study dates were between March 2013 and May 2015. Two-day fear conditioning and extinction paradigm. Skin conductance responses, blood oxygenation level-dependent responses, trait anxiety scores from the State Trait Anxiety Inventory - Trait Form, and functiona l connectivity. This study included 21 healthy controls (10 women) and 61 individuals with anxiety disorders (36 women). P values reported for the neuroimaging results are all familywise error corrected. Skin conductance responses during extinction recall did not differ between individuals with anxiety disorders and healthy controls (ηp2 = 0.001, P = .79), where ηp2 is partial eta squared. The anxiety group had lower activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during extinction recall (ηp2 = 0.178, P = .02). A similar hypoactive pattern was found during early conditioning (ηp2 = 0.106, P = .009). The vmPFC hypoactivation was associated with anxiety symptom severity (r = -0.420, P = .01 for conditioning and r = -0.464, P = .004 for extinction recall) and the number of co-occuring anxiety disorders diagnosed (ηp2 = 0.137, P = .009 for conditioning and ηp2 = 0.227, P = .004 for extinction recall). Psychophysiological interaction analyses revealed that the fear network connectivity differed between healthy controls and the anxiety group during fear learning (ηp2 range between 0.088 and 0.176 and P range between 0.02 and 0.003) and extinction recall (ηp2 range between 0.111 and 0.235 and P range between 0.02 and 0.002). Despite no skin conductance response group differences during extinction recall, brain activation patterns between anxious and healthy individuals differed. These findings encourage future studies to examine the conditions longitudinally and in the context of treatment trials to improve and guide therapeutics via advanced neurobiological understanding of each disorder.",

      "document": "The bachelorette: Female Siamese fighting fish avoid males exposed to an estrogen mimic Due to improper disposal and a lack of removal during the wastewater treatment process, endocrine disrupting chemicals enter aquatic ecosystems where they exert detrimental effects on fish behavior and physiology. Perhaps the most well-studied and prevalent EDC is 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2), an active ingredient in oral contraceptives, which is known to cause dramatic reductions in male -typical behaviors. While it is likely that alterations in male courtship behavior decrease reproductive fitness, this is rarely explicitly examined. To this end, whether EE2 exposure reduces male attractiveness to female Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, was investigated by showing females video images of exposed and unexposed males. Females were randomly assigned to one of two exposure conditions (exposed to EE2, control) and each subject then viewed four different video combinations of male conspecifics (courting exposed + exposed; courting unexposed + unexposed; courting unexposed + exposed; swimming unexposed + exposed). Females, regardless of whether or not they were exposed to EE2, directed markedly less behavior towards exposed males, especially when they viewed an exposed male and an unexposed male simultaneously. These findings demonstrate that EE2 can have significant individual - and population-level consequences on fitness by disrupting sexual selection and, ultimately, the success of exposed males.",

However, in thicker samples, substantial background staining is common despite repeated rinsing, which can significantly reduce image contrast. Recently, ' paired-agent' methods -which employ co-administration of a control (untargeted) imaging agent -have been applied to thick - sample staining applications to account for background staining. To date, these methods have included (1) a simple ratiometric method that is relatively insensitive to noise in the data but has accuracy that is dependent on the staining protocol and the characteristics of the sample; and (2) a complex paired-agent kinetic modeling method that is more accurate but is more noise-sensitive and requires a precise serial rinsing protocol. Here, a new simplified mathematical model-the rinsing paired-agent model (RPAM)-is derived and tested that offers a good balance between the previous models, is adaptable to arbitrary rinsing-imaging protocols, and does not require calibration of the imaging system. RPAM is evaluated against previous models and is validated by comparison to estimated concentrations of targeted biomarkers on the surface of 3D cell culture and tumor xenograft models. This work supports the use of RPAM as a preferable model to quantitatively analyze targeted biomarker concentrations in topically stained thick tissues, as it was found to match the accuracy of the complex paired-agent kinetic model while retaining the low noise-sensitivity characteristics of the ratiometric method.",

Abnormalities in NPC proliferation, differentiation, survival, or integration have been linked to various neurological diseases including Fragile X syndrome. Yet, no studies have examined NPCs from the early postnatal Fragile X mouse hippocampus despite the importance of this developmental time point, which marks the highest expression level of FMRP, the protein missing in Fragile X, in the rodent hippocampus and is when hippocampal NPCs have migrated to the dentate gyrus (DG) to give rise to lifelong neurogenesis. In this study, we examined NPCs from the early postnatal hippocampus and DG of Fragile X mice (Fmr1 - KO). Immunocytochemistry on neurospheres showed increased Nestin expression and decreased Ki67 expression, which collectively indicated aberrant NPC biology. Intriguingly, flow cytometric analysis of the expression of the antigens CD15, CD24, CD133, GLAST, and PSA-NCAM showed a decreased proportion of neural stem cells (GLAST(+)CD15(+)CD133(+)) and an increased proportion of neuroblasts (PSA-NCAM(+)CD15(+)) in the DG of P7 Fmr1 - KO mice. This was mirrored by lower expression levels of Nestin and the mitotic marker phospho-histone H3 in vivo in the P9 hippocampus, as well as a decreased proportion of cells in the G2/M phases of the P7 DG. Thus, the absence of FMRP leads to fewer actively cycling NPCs, coinciding with a decrease in neural stem cells and an increase in neuroblasts. Together, these results show the importance of FMRP in the developing hippocampal formation and suggest abnormalities in cell cycle regulation in Fragile X.",

Neither smoking nor the use of snus, increased the risk for requiring a groin hernia repair. On the contrary, heavy smoking decreased the risk for men, HR 0.75 (95% CI 0.58-0.96), as did having a BMI over 30 kg/m(2) HR (men) 0.33 (95% CI 0.27-0.40).

Maternal depressive symptoms in late pregnancy and concentrations of cord blood 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) were measured in 1491 mother - infant pairs. Data on maternal sociodemographic characteristics, health status, lifestyle and birth outcomes were prospectively collected.

A significant, inverse linear relationship was noted between maternal depression scores and the concentration of 25(OH)D for infants born in winter - spring (adjusted β = -0.158; 95% CI: -0.259, -0.057). The significant, inverse linear relationship between maternal depression scores and fetomaternal ratios of 25(OH) D was also observed among the infants born in winter - spring (adjusted β = -0.005; 95% CI: -0.008, -0.003). MD appears to significantly attenuate the vitamin D concentrations and birth weight of infants born in winter - spring. A decreased fetomaternal ratio of 25(OH)D might be involved in this biological pathway.",

While early series demonstrated only about a 10% chance of infarction following posterior cerebral artery occlusion, recently several authors have advocated a bypass prior to parent vessel sacrifice in all cases. We present the case of an adult man with a fusiform aneurysm of the right posterior cerebral artery at the P2-P3 junction. He clinically failed a balloon test occlusion preoperatively and therefore underwent an occipital artery to distal posterior cerebral artery bypass with subsequent endovascular occlusion of the parent vessel and aneurysm. Despite the fact that the immediate and 6 month follow up cerebral angiography confirmed a patent bypass, the patient still developed a posterior cerebral artery territory stroke. We believe this case demonstrates that successful distal revascularization in the setting of proximal posterior cerebral artery occlusion does not guarantee against cerebral ischemia and infarction even in those patients that fail a test occlusion.",

Fish ectoparasites make initial contact with their hosts at body surfaces, such as skin and gills, which are covered with mucosa that are similar to those of mammalian guts. Fish are among the most primitive vertebrates with immune systems that are equivalent to those in mammals, and they produce and secrete IgM into mucus. In this study, we showed that the monogenean parasite Heterobothrium okamotoi utilizes IgM to recognize its host, fugu Takifugu rubripes Oncomiracidia are infective larvae of H. okamotoi that shed their cilia and metamorphose into juveniles when exposed to purified d-mannose - binding fractions from fugu mucus. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, proteins contained in the fraction were identified as d-mannose -specific IgM with two d-mannose -binding lectins. However, although deciliation was significantly induced by IgM and was inhibited by d-mannose or a specific Ab against fugu IgM, other lectins had no effect, and IgM without d-mannose affinity induced deciliation to a limited degree. Subsequent immunofluorescent staining experiments showed that fugu d-mannose -specific IgM binds ciliated epidermal cells of oncomiracidium. These observations suggest that deciliation is triggered by binding of fugu IgM to cell surface Ags via Ag binding sites. Moreover, concentrations of d-mannose - binding IgM in gill mucus were sufficient to induce deciliation in vitro, indicating that H. okamotoi parasites initially use host Abs to colonize host gills.",

However, it is difficult to place the tip in a correct location in neonates because of the unreliable estimated length by surface landmark. Therefore, we evaluated the feasibility and safety of an improved intracavitary electrocardiogram (IC - ECG) technique in guiding PICC placement in neonates based on the ratios of P/R wave amplitudes on IC - ECG. The results showed that all of the 32 neonates whose PICCs had been successfully placed and correct tip position verified by chest radiography acquired qualified P wave on IC - ECG. The average ratio of P/R wave amplitude was 0.6 ± 0.1, with a range of 0.4 to 0.8. The 49 neonates who received IC - ECG -guided PICC catheterization showed higher success rates of correct PICC tip position on the first attempt than traditional, predetermined length estimation on surface landmark (93.9% vs 62.5%, χ = 18.01, P < .001). No significant complications occurred in the studied neonates. Based on these findings, IC - ECG -guided tip placement appears to be a promising approach in improving the success rate of tip location when placing a PICC in neonates.",

      "document": "Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry -based quantitative proteomics analysis reveals chondroprotective effects of astragaloside IV in interleukin-1β - induced SW1353 chondrocyte-like cells Chondrocyte apoptosis played a key role on the progression of Osteoarthritis (OA). Safe and effective drugs are urgently needed for the treatment of OA. Previous study reported that Astragaloside IV (ASG-IV) had exerted a protective effect against articular cartilage degeneration by promoting rapid proliferation of chondrocyte. Therefore, the aim of our study is to explore the effects and mechanisms of ASG-IV in chondrocyte apoptosis. Isobaric Tags For Relative And Absolute Quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomics was used to quantitatively detect and map proteins in SW1353 chondrocyte-like cells pre-treated with ASG-IV or interleukin-1β (IL-1β) or ASG-IV + IL-1β. The iTRAQ-labeled peptides were fractionated by high-accuracy liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Cell apoptosis and differentially expressed proteins was detected by flow cytometry (FCM), quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and western blotting, respectively. The apoptosis of the IL-1β - induced SW1353 cells treated with ASG-IV was greatly inhibited. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that gamma actin 1 (ACTG1) and Yes Associated Protein 1 (YAP1), participating in the Hippo signaling pathway and Vitronectin (VTN) and Collagen Type I Alpha 1 Chain (COL1A1), involving in the extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction signaling pathway, were all significantly up-regulated in the IL-1β - induced SW1353 cells after treatment with ASG-IV. The qRT-PCR and Western blotting results confirmed the up-regulation of these four genes. ASG-IV played a positive role in human osteoarthritic chondrocyte apoptosis, possibly through modulation of the Hippo signaling pathway by up-regulating YAP1 and ACTG1 expression, and also by up-regulating VTN and COL1A1, which are involved in the ECM-receptor interaction pathway. Taken together, all the results suggested that ASG-IV had a novel therapeutic potential for the treatment of OA.",

Many studies support the role of probiotics as a contributor to gastrointestinal health, and nowadays many authors are trying to prove its influence in oral health maintenance. To review the published literature with the purpose of knowing the importance of using probiotics as a preventive and therapeutic method for oral infectious diseases management. An electronic search in PubMed database with the keywords \" oral health AND probiotics AND dentistry \" was conducted. The inclusion criteria were: randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that assess the action of any probiotic strain in the treatment and / or prevention of an infectious oral disease, RCTs that assess the action of any probiotic strain on counting colony forming units (CFU) of oral pathogens, systematic reviews and meta-analysis. The Jadad scale was used to assess the high quality of RCTs. Fifteen articles were considered for this review. Of which, 12 were RCTs of good / high quality (Jadad scale), two meta-analysis and one systematic review. The literature reviewed suggests probiotics usage could be beneficial for the maintenance of oral health, due to its ability to decrease the colony forming units (CFU) counts of the oral pathogens. However, randomized clinical trials with long-term follow-up periods are needed to confirm their efficacy in reducing the prevalence/incidence of oral infectious diseases. Furthermore, the recognition of specific strains with probiotic activity for each infectious oral disease is required, in order to determine exact dose, treatment time and ideal vehicles.",

After obtaining institutional review board approval, review was performed of emergency department (ED) patients who had CTPA and follow-up echocardiogram within 48 h, over 18 months. Patients with pulmonary embolus, suboptimal CTPA, arrhythmias or pericardial tamponade were excluded. One hundred thirty-seven patients were identified and divided into cases (LVEF <40%, n = 52) and controls (LVEF >50%, n = 85). Two reviewers performed these analyses: measurement of enhancement in main pulmonary artery (MPA), LV, and aorta; subjective enhancement of LV and aorta (Ao) relative to MPA using a four-point Likert scale; contrast transit time (TD) to trigger CTPA and LV short & long axis dimensions. When available, the most recent N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level was recorded. Decreased aortic and LV subjective enhancement were the best predictors of LV systolic dysfunction. For Ao / MPA ratio, an optimal cutoff value of 0.20 resulted in a sensitivity of 0.54 and specificity of 0.93 (AUC = 0.83, 0.78-0.88 95% CI). A threshold of 86.7 HU for Ao enhancement resulted in a sensitivity of 0.68 and specificity of 0.90 (AUC = 0.82, 0.77-0.88 95% CI). A LV short axis diameter of more than 54.3 mm had a sensitivity of 0.62 and specificity of 0.98 (AUC = 0.88, 0.83-0.92 95% CI). For the LV long axis diameter, a cutoff of 87.5 mm resulted in a sensitivity of 0.66 and specificity of 0.84 (AUC = 0.78, 0.72-0.84 95% CI). With bolus timing, cases had a longer TD (13.4 vs. 10.4 s, p < 0.0001). Unsuspected LV systolic dysfunction can be recognized on a CTPA by identification of decreased aortic enhancement, LV enlargement and increased TD. This has important diagnostic implications for the patient presenting with shortness of breath, chest pain, or dyspnea.",

      "document": "Fucoxanthin provides neuroprotection in models of traumatic brain injury via the Nrf2 - ARE and Nrf2 - autophagy pathways Fucoxanthin is abundant in seaweed and is considered as a powerful antioxidant. It has been proposed to possess anti-cancer, anti-obesity and anti-diabetes effects. However, its roles in brain injury models have not been fully understood. The objective of this study was to investigate the neuroprotection of fucoxanthin in models of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the role of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)- antioxidant-response element (ARE) and Nrf2 - autophagy pathways in the putative neuroprotection. We found that fucoxanthin alleviated TBI -induced secondary brain injury, including neurological deficits, cerebral edema, brain lesion and neuronal apoptosis. Moreover, the up-regulation of malondialdehyde (MDA) and the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were reversed by fucoxanthin treatment. Furthermore, our in vitro studies demonstrated that fucoxanthin increased the neuron survival and reduced the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. In addition, fucoxanthin activated the Nrf2 - ARE pathway and autophagy both in vivo and in vitro, which was proven by the results of immunohistochemistry, western blot and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). However, fucoxanthin failed to provide neuroprotection and activated autophagy following TBI in Nrf2 (-/-) mice. In conclusion, our studies indicated that fucoxanthin provided neuroprotective effects in models of TBI, potentially via regulation of the Nrf2 - ARE and Nrf2 - autophagy pathways.",

By real-time PCR and western blots, we first quatified expressions of L-type Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 calcium channel α1 subunits in the SN of experimental mice treated with MPTP. We found that the expressions of Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 calcium channel α1 subunits markedly increased after MPTP treatment for 2 and 3 weeks. Secondly, we observed the effects of isradipine, a LTCC antagonist, on MPTP - induced DA neuron degeneration and iron accumulation in the SN. Our results showed that isradipine treatment prevented against MPTP - induced Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 calcium channel α1 subunits up-regulation in the SN. We also found that isradipine prevented against MPTP - induced DA neuron depletion in the SN and partly restored the DA content in the striatum. Moreover, we found that isradipine inhibited the increase of iron positive cells in the SN of the MPTP - treated mice. Finally, we investigated the effects of isradipine on cellular iron accumulation in the dopaminergic MES23.5 cell line. Our studies showed that MPP+ treatment accelerated iron influx in the MES23.5 cells. Treatment with Bayk8644 further aggravated iron accumulation. Treatment with isradipine prevented against MPP+ - induced iron influx in the MES23.5 cells. These results suggest that up-regulation of LTCCs may be responsible for the DA neuron degeneration in the MPTP - treated mice, The LTCCs may directly contribute to iron influx into DA neurons, and isradipine may suppress cellular iron accumulation and prevents neurodegeneration.",

In this study, we used avirulent wild type and virulent mutant isolates of Puccinia striiformis to characterize the interactions in wheat carrying yellow rust Yr2 resistance. Both conventional and advanced microscopic techniques were used for a detailed study of morphology and growth of fungal colonies and associated host cell responses. The growth of the wild type isolates was highly restricted due to hypersensitive response (HR, plant cell death) indicated by autofluorescence and change in the shape of the affected plant cells. The host response appeared post - haustorial, but large variation in the time and stage of arrest was observed for individual fungal colonies, probably due to a delay between detection and response. Some colonies were stopped right after the formation of the primary infection hyphae whereas others formed highly branched mycelia. HR was first observed in host cells in direct contact with fungal structures, after which the defense responses spread to adjacent host cells, and eventually led to encasement of the fungal colony. Several cells with HR contained haustoria, which were small and underdeveloped, but some cells contained normal sized haustoria without signs of hypersensitivity. The growth of the virulent mutants in the resistant plants was similar to the growth in plants without Yr2 resistance, which is a strong indication that the incompatible phenotype was associated with Yr2. The interaction between P. striiformis and wheat with Yr2 resistance was highly variable in time and space, which demonstrate that histological studies are important for a deeper understanding of host-pathogen interactions and plant defense mechanisms in general.",

Drug loaded magnetic nanoparticles by using external magnetic field could selectively accumulate the drug at the target site and thereby reduce the doses required to achieve therapeutic concentration which may otherwise produce serious side effects on healthy cells. In the present study the artemisinin magnetic nanoparticles were successfully formulated using chitosan by ionic-gelation method. The developed magnetic nanoparticles of artemisinin were smooth and spherical in nature and their size was in the range of 349-445nm. The polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential of the formulated nanoparticles were in the range of 0.373-0.908 and -9.34 to -33.3 respectively. They showed 55% to 62.5% of drug encapsulation efficiency and 20% to 25% drug loading capacity. Around 62% to 78% of artemisinin was released from the artemisinin magnetic nanoparticles over the period of 48h.

      "document": "Precise prediction of activators for the human constitutive androstane receptor using structure -based three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship methods The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3) regulates the expression of numerous drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters. The upregulation of various enzymes, including CYP2B6, by CAR activators is a critical problem leading to clinically severe drug-drug interactions (DDIs). To date, however, few effective computational approaches for identifying CAR activators exist. In this study, we aimed to develop three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) models to predict the CAR activating potency of compounds emerging in the drug-discovery process. Models were constructed using comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) based on the molecular alignments of ligands binding to CAR, which were obtained from ensemble ligand-docking using 28 compounds as a training set. The CoMFA model, modified by adding a lipophilic parameter with calculated logD7.4 (S+logD7.4), demonstrated statistically good predictive ability (r(2) = 0.99, q(2) = 0.74). We also confirmed the excellent predictability of the 3D-QSAR model for CAR activation (r(2)pred = 0.71) using seven compounds as a test set for external validation. Collectively, our results indicate that the 3D-QSAR model developed in this study provides precise prediction of CAR activating potency and, thus, should be useful for selecting drug candidates with minimized DDI risk related to enzyme-induction in the early drug-discovery stage.",

We assessed the association of UACR with cardiac structure and function in the Echocardiographic Study of Latinos (Echo-SOL), an ancillary study of the Hispanic Community Health Study / Study of Latinos across 4 US sites. Echo-SOL participants underwent standard 2-dimensional echocardiography, including speckle-tracking strain analysis. UACR was categorized as normal and high-normal (based on the midpoint of values below microalbuminuria), microalbuminuria (≥17 mg/g for men; ≥25 mg/g for women), and macroalbuminuria (≥250 mg/g; ≥355 mg/g). Simultaneous assessments were made of left ventricular (LV) mass index and hypertrophy and measures of LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction. We assessed the association of UACR with subclinical cardiac measures, adjusting for sociodemographic and cardiometabolic factors. Among 1,815 participants (median age 54, women 65%), 42% had normal UACR, 43% high-normal UACR, 13% microalbuminuria, and 2% macroalbuminuria. Prevalence of LV hypertrophy was 13%, LV systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction <50%) 3%, and diastolic dysfunction 53%. After covariate adjustment, both micro- and macroalbuminuria were significantly associated with a twofold increase in LV hypertrophy. Microalbuminuria but not macroalbuminuria was associated with worse global longitudinal strain. Elevated UACR, even at high-normal levels, was significantly associated with greater diastolic dysfunction. In conclusion, elevated UACR was associated with LV hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction in the largest known population sample of US Hispanic / Latinos. Screening and detection of even high-normal UACR could be of value to guide cardiovascular disease prevention efforts among Hispanic / Latino Americans.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the robustness of both techniques in identifying atrial drivers noninvasively under the effect of electrical noise or model uncertainties. Inverse - computed DFs and phase maps were obtained from 30 different mathematical AF simulations. Epicardial highest dominant frequency (HDF) regions and rotor location were compared with the same inverse - computed measurements after addition of noise to the ECG, size variations of the atria, and linear or angular deviations in the atrial location inside the thorax. Inverse - computed electrograms (EGMs) individually correlated poorly with the original EGMs in the absence of induced uncertainties (0.45 ± 0.12) and were worse with 10-dB noise (0.22 ± 0.11), 3-cm displacement (0.01 ± 0.02), or 36° rotation (0.02 ± 0.03). However, inverse - computed HDF regions showed robustness against induced uncertainties: from 82% ± 18% match for the best conditions, down to 73% ± 23% for 10-dB noise, 77% ± 21% for 5-cm displacement, and 60% ± 22% for 36° rotation. The distance from the inverse - computed rotor to the original rotor was also affected by uncertainties: 0.8 ± 1.61 cm for the best conditions, 2.4 ± 3.6 cm for 10-dB noise, 4.3 ± 3.2 cm for 4-cm displacement, and 4.0 ± 2.1 cm for 36° rotation. Restriction of rotor detections to the HDF area increased rotor detection accuracy from 4.5 ± 4.5 cm to 3.2 ± 3.1 cm (P <.05) with 0-dB noise. The combination of frequency and phase- derived measurements increases the accuracy of noninvasive localization of atrial rotors driving AF in the presence of noise and uncertainties in atrial location or size.",

      "document": "A comparison of DALYs for periodontal disease in China between 1990 and 2013: insights from the 2013 global burden of disease study China has undergone a rapid demographic and epidemiological transition with fast ecomonic development since the 1980s. Oral health is becoming a major public health problem as the prevalence of non-communicable diseases has greatly increased. Periodontal disease (PD) and caries are among the most prevalent oral diseases. PD accounts for the majority of tooth loss and increases with age. China's third national epidemiological investigation on oral diseases (2005) revealed that periodontitis affected >50% of the adult population. The Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013) have been used to estimate DALYs for 301 acute and chronic diseases and injuries in 188 countries for 1990-2013. The estimation of burden of PD between 1990 and 2013 will provide a unique perspective for planning interventions and developing public health policies for PD even chronic diseases in China. We used the GBD 2013 results for Years of Life Lost (YLLs) and Years Lived with Disability (YLDs) to calculate Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) for PD in China. PD standardized DALYs rate (SDR) per 100,000 persons, the percentage of PD standardized DALYs rate (% PD SDR) in all diseases DALYs, and variance ratio of these two indexes between the years of 1990 and 2013 were compared by province, gender and age groups. Nationwide, compared to 1990, the SDR in 2013 increased slightly from 24.7 to 25.7, while the variance ratio of SDR for provinces in the middle, west and south of China showed a greater variation(4.8-6.2%). The % PD SDR in all disease DALYs increased from 0.06 to 0.11% for all groups. The four highest variance ratios % PD SDR in all diseases DALYs between 1990 and 2013 occurred in the west of China (97, 98.6, 108.4 and 112.8%). The PD SDR changed slightly in the women (20.3 to 21.7), meanwhile the variance ratio of PD SDR and % PD SDR in all diseases DALYs for the women (6.7 and 94.5%) was also higher than for men (2.1 and 60.6%). The highest variance ratio % PD SDR in all oral diseases DALYs occurred between 1990 and 2013 in ages 20 to 24 (50.7%) and 25 to 29 years (50.5%). The PD standardized DALYs rate and % PD SDR in all diseases DALYs in China in 2013 has increased from 1990. Especially, the variance ratio of % PD SDR in all disease DALYs among Young population and women, in the west provinces of China have been becoming the highest in all age groups and national wide. Future intervention measurements should include young women of child-bearing age because women's health impacts infant health. Periodontal disease has risk factors in common with a number of other non-communicable diseases (NCD) and conditions, and focusing on the common behavioral and environmental risk factors would be instrumental in the effective prevention of periodontal disease.",

Both mindfulness and resilience aid in handling stress, stress increases the risk of rumination and/or worry especially in females and they are more empathetic than other healthcare students. To identify correlates and predictors of the resilience among nursing students. This is a descriptive correlation study and we have recruited 194 participants (1-4(th) year B.Sc Nursing) from Government College of Nursing and NIMHANS College of Nursing in Bangalore, India. The following instruments were used to collect the data, Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI), Toronto Empathy Questionnaire (TEQ), Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ) and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC). Data was analysed using Pearson's correlation test and multiple regression analysis. Resilience is significantly correlated with mindfulness, perseverative thinking and empathy in nursing students. Based on regression analysis this model accounted for almost 33% of variance in resilience. This result is of interest as mindfulness alone explained 23% of the variance and unproductive Repeated Negative Thinking (RNT) and RNT consuming mental capacity predicted 8% and 2% respectively. These results support the importance of resilience and mindfulness in nursing students. Hence, resilience and/or mindfulness enhancing interventions should be inculcated in nursing education.",

A retrospective clinical study was conducted among patients who had undergone rhinoseptoplasty using ACC or IHCC from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2014. Patients were followed up for more than 1 year after surgery and the histologic characteristics of ACC and IHCC were compared. The details of the surgical procedures and complications, including warping, infection, resorption, and/or donor-site morbidity, were evaluated by reviewing medical records and facial photographs. Patients ' subjective satisfaction with aesthetic and functional results was evaluated using a questionnaire. The details of the surgical procedures and complications, including warping, infection, resorption, and/or donor-site morbidity; patients ' subjective satisfaction with aesthetic and functional results ' objective evaluation of surgical outcomes, including symmetry, dorsal height, dorsal length, dorsal width, tip projection, tip rotation, tip width, and overall result; and histologic structures. Objective evaluation of surgical outcomes was graded using the Objective Rhinoplasty Outcome Score, which assessed symmetry, dorsal height, dorsal length, dorsal width, tip projection, tip rotation, tip width, and overall result. Histologic structures were evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin, Masson trichrome, Alcian blue, and Verhoeff elastic stains. A total of 63 patients (27 males and 36 females; mean [SD] age, 30.6 [9.5] years) had rhinoseptoplasty using ACC and 20 (9 males and 11 females; mean [SD] age, 35.4 [15.4] years) had rhinoseptoplasty using IHCC. Among observed complications, only notable resorption occurred more frequently in patients using IHCC (6 [30%]) than with ACC (2 [3%]) (P = .002). In subjective evaluations of aesthetic satisfaction, patients who received ACC showed significantly greater satisfaction (37 of 51 patients [73%] were very satisfied) than did those who received IHCC (6 of 20 [30%]) (P = .001). However, there was no between-group difference in subjective functional outcomes: 4 of 51 patients receiving ACC (8%) and 5 of 20 receiving IHCC (25%) were satisfied (P = .50) and 45 of 51 receiving ACC (88%) and 15 of 20 receiving IHCC (75%) were very satisfied (P = .15). Regarding objective aesthetic outcomes, all scores for both ACC and IHCC were more than 3.1 (between good and excellent). Histologic analyses showed larger, more evenly distributed, uniform chondrocytes and more collagens and proteoglycan contents in ACC than in IHCC. Compared with patients receiving IHCC, those receiving ACC for rhinoseptoplasty showed superior aesthetic satisfaction; ACC also had less frequent notable resorption. Autologous costal cartilage also had better histologic properties than IHCC did, suggesting it as an ideal graft material with less chance of long-term resorption. 3.",

      "document": "The role of cPLA2 in Methylglyoxal - induced cell apoptosis of HUVECs Methylglyoxal (MGO), a highly reactive dicarbonyl compound, is mainly formed as a byproduct of glycolysis. Elevated MGO level is known to induce apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells, which is implicated with progression of atherosclerosis and diabetic complications. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been exhaustively investigated yet. Here, we further characterized the mechanisms how MGO induced apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Our data revealed that cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) played an important role in MGO - induced cell apoptosis. It was found that MGO could increase both the activity and expression of cPLA2. Inhibition of cPLA2 by Pyrrophenone (PYR) or siRNA significantly attenuated the MGO - induced apoptosis. Additionally, MGO time - dependently decreased the phosphorylation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). Pretreatment of the cells with NF-κB inhibitor, BAY11-7082, further increased MGO - induced apoptosis of HUVECs, indicating that NF-κB played a survival role in this MGO - induced apoptosis. Furthermore, in the presence of si-cPLA2 or PYR, MGO no longer decreased NF-κB phosphorylation. Beyond that, the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) could reverse the changes of both cPLA2 and NF-κB caused by MGO. p38, the upstream of cPLA2, was also significantly phosphorylated by MGO. However, p38 inhibitor failed to reverse the apoptosis induced by MGO. This study gives an important insight into the downstream signaling mechanisms of MGO, cPLA2 - NF-κB, in endothelial apoptosis.",

The silver particles, found both inside and outside of the pores that characterize the PEO layer, produced an efficacious antimicrobial effect both against E. coli and S. aureus.",

Most freely available brain atlases are generated from relatively young individuals and not always derived from well-defined cohort studies.

In this study, we tested cervical tissues at various stages of tumor progression for 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels and also DNA promoter methylation profile of a panel of genes for its diagnostic potential. In total, 5-methylcytosine, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, and promoter methylation of 33 genes were evaluated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based technique, and bisulfate-based next generation sequencing. The 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine contents were significantly reduced in squamous cell carcinoma and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed a significant difference in (1) 5-methylcytosine between normal and squamous cell carcinoma tissues (area under the curve = 0.946) and (2) 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels among normal, squamous intraepithelial lesions and squamous cell carcinoma. Analyses of our next generation sequencing results and data from five independent published studies consisting of 191 normal, 10 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, 21 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and 335 malignant tissues identified a panel of nine genes (ARHGAP6, DAPK1, HAND2, NKX2-2, NNAT, PCDH10, PROX1, PITX2, and RAB6C) which could effectively discriminate among the various groups with sensitivity and specificity of 80%-100% (p < 0.05). Furthermore, 12 gene promoters (ARHGAP6, HAND2, LHX9, HEY2, NKX2-2, PCDH10, PITX2, PROX1, TBX3, IKBKG, RAB6C, and DAPK1) were also methylated in one or more of the cervical cancer cell lines tested. The global and gene - specific methylation of the panel of genes identified in our study may serve as useful biomarkers for the early detection and clinical management of cervical cancer.",

      "document": "Higher risk of revision for infection using systemic clindamycin prophylaxis than with cloxacillin Background and purpose - Clindamycin has not been compared with other antibiotics for prophylaxis in arthroplasty. Since 2009, the Swedish Knee Arthroplasty Register (SKAR) has been collecting information on the prophylactic antibiotic regime used at every individual operation. In Sweden, when there is allergy to penicillin, clindamycin has been the recommended alternative. We examined whether there were differences in the rate of revision due to infection depending on which antibiotic was used as systemic prophylaxis. Patients and methods - Patients who had a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) performed due to osteoarthritis (OA) during the years 2009-2015 were included in the study. Information on which antibiotic was used was available for 80,018 operations (55,530 patients). Survival statistics were used to calculate the rate of revision due to infection until the end of 2015, comparing the group of patients who received cloxacillin with those who received clindamycin as systemic prophylaxis. Results - Cloxacillin was used in 90% of the cases, clindamycin in 7%, and cephalosporins in 2%. The risk of being revised due to infection was higher when clindamycin was used than when cloxacillin was used (RR =1.5, 95% CI: 1.2-2.0; p = 0.001). There was no significant difference in the revision rate for other causes (p = 0.2). Interpretation - We advise that patients reporting allergic reaction to penicillin should have their allergic history explored. In the absence of a clear history of type-I allergic reaction (e.g. urticaria, anaphylaxis, or bronchospasm), we suggest the use of a third-generation cephalosporin instead of clindamycin as perioperative prophylaxis when undergoing a TKR. No recommendation can be given regarding patients with type-1 allergy.",

      "document": "Chloroplast function and ion regulation in plants growing on saline soils: lessons from halophytes Salt stress impacts multiple aspects of plant metabolism and physiology. For instance it inhibits photosynthesis through stomatal limitation, causes excessive accumulation of sodium and chloride in chloroplasts, and disturbs chloroplast potassium homeostasis. Most research on salt stress has focused primarily on cytosolic ion homeostasis with few studies of how salt stress affects chloroplast ion homeostasis. This review asks the question whether membrane-transport processes and ionic relations are differentially regulated between glycophyte and halophyte chloroplasts and whether this contributes to the superior salt tolerance of halophytes. The available literature indicates that halophytes can overcome stomatal limitation by switching to CO2 concentrating mechanisms and increasing the number of chloroplasts per cell under saline conditions. Furthermore, salt entry into the chloroplast stroma may be critical for grana formation and photosystem II activity in halophytes but not in glycophytes. Salt also inhibits some stromal enzymes (e.g. fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase) to a lesser extent in halophyte species. Halophytes accumulate more chloride in chloroplasts than glycophytes and appear to use sodium in functional roles. We propose the molecular identities of candidate transporters that move sodium, chloride and potassium across chloroplast membranes and discuss how their operation may regulate photochemistry and photosystem I and II activity in chloroplasts.",

Transfer to a tissue culture environment results in rapid and extensive downregulation of microglia -specific genes that are induced in primitive mouse macrophages following migration into the fetal brain. Substantial subsets of these genes exhibit altered expression in neurodegenerative and behavioral diseases and are associated with non-coding risk variants.

      "document": "BREEDING AND GENETICS SYMPOSIUM: Breeding for resilience to heat stress effects in dairy ruminants. A comprehensive review Selection for heat tolerant (HT) animals in dairy production has been so far linked to estimation of declines in production using milk recording and meteorological information on the day of control using reaction norms. Results from these models show that there is a reasonable amount of genetic variability in the individual response to high heat loads, which makes feasible selection of HT animals at low costs. However, the antagonistic relationship between level of production and response to heat stress (HS) implies that selection for HT animals under this approach must be done with caution so that productivity is not damaged. Decomposition of the genetic variability in principal components (PC) can provide selection criteria independent of milk production level although biological interpretation of PC is difficult. Moreover, given that response to heat stress for each animal is estimated with very sparse information collected under different physiological and management circumstances, biased (normally underestimation) and lack of accuracy may be expected. Alternative phenotypic characterization of HT can come from the use of physiological traits, which have also shown moderate heritability. However, costs of a large scale implementation based on physiological characteristics has precluded its use. Another alternative is the use of biomarkers that define heat tolerance. A review of biomarkers of HS from more recent studies is provided. Of particular interest are milk biomarkers, which together with infrared spectra prediction equations can provide useful tools for genetic selection. In the 'omics' era, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics have been already used to detect genes affecting HT. A review of findings in these areas is also provided. Except for the slick hair gene, there are no other genes for which variants have been clearly associated with HT. However, integration of omics information could help in pointing at knots of the HS control network and, in the end, to a panel of markers to be used in the selection of HT animals. Overall, HT is a complex phenomenon that requires integration of fine phenotypes and omics information to provide accurate tools for selection without damaging productivity. Technological developments to make on-farm implementation feasible and with greater insight into the key biomarkers and genes involved in HT are needed.",

      "document": "Paraoxonases and psoriasis: negative imbalance of anti--oxidant endogenous mechanisms Numerous reports have shown that psoriasis patients are more exposed to lipoprotein peroxidation and to a decrease in the activity of paraoxonase (PON)1, an anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory enzyme. Thus, it has been suggested that malfunction of the anti-oxidant system and an increased production of reactive oxygen species drive immune inflammatory events, that result in progressive skin cell damage in patients with psoriasis. The PON protein family, including PON1, PON2 and PON3, is one of the most important endogenous defense mechanisms against oxidative stress. In the present study, we investigated PON gene expression in psoriasis and in cutaneous oxidative stress. The study population included 10 patients affected by moderate -to- severe plaque psoriasis and 15 healthy donors who have undergone to plastic surgery, were used as control. Skin punch biopsies of lesional and non lesional psoriatic skin were performed for analysis of PON2 and PON3 gene expression. In addition, oxidation assays in ex vivo full-thickness healthy skin organ cultures were performed. No significant differences were observed between PON2 and PON3 gene expression in psoriatic lesional and non lesional skin compared with healthy controls. H2O2 treatment induced a significant decrease of PON2 and PON3 expression in ex vivo full-thickness healthy skin organ cultures; conversely the pre-treatment of samples with the anti-oxidant reagent N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) induced a significant increase. Interestingly, no significant alterations were reported for PON2 and PON3 expression in ex vivo full-thickness healthy skin organ cultures stimulated with IL-17. Taken together our findings have revealed that a strong pro-oxidative activity is not effectively countered by anti-oxidant endogenous mechanisms both in psoriatic skin and in ex vivo experimental model.",

      "document": "Estrogen deficiency accelerates lumbar facet joints arthritis Dramatic increase in the prevalence of lumbar facet joint (LFJ) arthritis in women around the age of menopause indicates a protective role for estrogen in LFJ arthritis. To date, there is no evidence for this indication and the mechanism of such an effect remains poorly understood. In this study, ovariectomized (OVX) mice were used to mimic the estrogen - deficient status of post-menopausal women. Micro-CT and immunohistochemistry was employed to assess the morphological and molecular changes in ovariectomy - induced LFJ arthritis. The results show that the LFJ subchondral bone mass was significantly decreased in OVX mice, with increased cavities on the interface of the subchondral bone. Severe cartilage degradation was observed in ovariectomy - induced LFJ arthritis. Increased blood vessels and innervations were also found in degenerated LFJ, particularly in the subchondral bone area. 17β-Estradiol treatment efficiently suppressed LFJ subchondral bone turnover, markedly inhibited cartilage degradation, and increased blood vessel and nerve ending growth in degenerated LFJ in OVX mice. Our study reveals that estrogen is a key factor in regulating LFJ metabolism. Severe LFJ degeneration occurs when estrogen is absent in vivo. Collapsed subchondral bone may be the initiation of this process, and estrogen replacement therapy can effectively prevent degeneration of LFJ under estrogen - deficient conditions.",

Alongside evidence that the condition is heritable, mutations in single genes have been reported in few human supernumerary tooth cases. Gene sequencing methods in tradition way are time-consuming and labor-intensive, whereas next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics are cost-effective for large samples and target sizes. We describe the application of a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatics approach to samples from 17 mesiodens patients. Subjects were diagnosed on the basis of panoramic radiograph. A total of 101 candidate genes which were captured custom genes were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500. Multistep bioinformatics processing was performed including variant identification, base calling, and in silico analysis of putative disease - causing variants. Targeted capture identified 88 non-synonymous, rare, exonic variants involving 42 of the 101 candidate genes. Moreover, we investigated gene co-occurrence relationships between the genomic alterations and identified 88 significant relationships among 18 most recurrent driver alterations. Our search for co-occurring genetic alterations revealed that such alterations interact cooperatively to drive mesiodens. We discovered a gene co-occurrence network in mesiodens patients with functionally enriched gene groups in the sonic hedgehog (SHH), bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), and wingless integrated (WNT) signaling pathways.",

In five patients nature of injury was known in other two patients exact nature of injury was not known. After primary closure five patients with known injury survived and two patients with unknown injury died. As per our experience, we recommend primary closure, if the exact nature of injury is known as the outcome is definitely favourable.",

Here we report the first demonstration of single contig genome assembly using Oxford Nanopore native barcoding when applied to a multiplexed library of 12 samples and combined with existing Illumina short-read data. This paves the way for the closure of multiple bacterial genomes from a single MinION(TM) sequencing run, given the availability of existing short-read data. The strain we used, MHO_001, represents the important community-acquired methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus lineage USA300. Using a hybrid assembly of existing short read and barcoded long read sequences from multiplexed data, we completed a genome of the S. aureus USA300 strain MHO_001. The long-read data represented only ~5-10% of an average MinION(TM) run (~7x genomic coverage), but, using standard tools, this was sufficient to complete the circular chromosome of S. aureus strain MHO_001 (2.86 Mb) and two complete plasmids (27 Kb and 3 Kb). Minor differences were noted when compared to USA300 reference genome, USA300_FPR3757, including the translocation, loss and gain of mobile genetic elements. Here we demonstrate that MinION(TM) reads, multiplexed using native barcoding, can be used in combination with short-read data, to fully complete a bacterial genome. The ability to complete multiple genomes, for which short-read data is already available, from a single MinION(TM) run is set to impact on our understanding of accessory genome content, plasmid diversity and genome rearrangements.",

      "document": "Preliminary results from direct-to-facility vaccine deliveries in Kano, Nigeria As part of its vaccine supply chain redesign efforts, Kano state now pushes vaccines directly from 6 state stores to primary health centers equipped with solar refrigerators. Our objective is to describe preliminary results from the first 20 months of Kano's direct vaccine delivery operations. This is a retrospective review of Kano's direct vaccine delivery program. We analyzed trends in health facility vaccine stock levels, and examined the relationship between stock-out rates and each of cascade vaccine deliveries and timeliness of deliveries. Analysis of vaccination trends was based on administrative data from 27 sentinel health facilities. Costs for both the in-sourced and out-sourced approaches were estimated using a bottoms-up model-based approach. Overall stock adequacy increased from 54% in the first delivery cycle to 68% by cycle 33. Conversely, stock-out rates decreased from 41% to 10% over the same period. Similar trends were observed in the out-sourced and in-sourced programs. Stock-out rates rose incrementally with increasing number of cascade facilities, and delays in vaccine deliveries correlated strongly with stock-out rates. Recognizing that stock availability is one of many factors contributing to vaccinations, we nonetheless compared pre - and post - direct deliveries vaccinations in sentinel facilities, and found statistically significant upward trends for 4 out of 6 antigens. 1 antigen (measles) showed an upward trend that was not statistically significant. Hepatitis b vaccinations declined during the period. Overall, there appeared to be a one- year lag between commencement of direct deliveries and the increase in number of vaccinations. Weighted average cost per delivery is US$29.8 and cost per child immunized is US$0.7 per year. Direct vaccine delivery to health facilities in Kano, through a streamlined architecture, has resulted in decreased stock-outs and improved stock adequacy. Concurrent operation of insourced and outsourced programs has enabled Kano build in-house logistics capabilities.",

      "document": "Blur perception throughout the visual field in myopia and emmetropia We evaluated the ability of emmetropic and myopic observers to detect and discriminate blur across the retina under monocular or binocular viewing conditions. We recruited 39 young (23-30 years) healthy adults (n = 19 myopes) with best-corrected visual acuity 0.0 LogMAR (20/20) or better in each eye and no binocular or accommodative dysfunction. Monocular and binocular blur discrimination thresholds were measured as a function of pedestal blur using naturalistic stimuli with an adaptive 4AFC procedure. Stimuli were presented in a 46° diameter window at 40 cm. Gaussian blur pedestals were confined to an annulus at either 0°, 4°, 8°, or 12° eccentricity, with a blur increment applied to only one quadrant of the image. The adaptive procedure efficiently estimated a dipper shaped blur discrimination threshold function with two parameters: intrinsic blur and blur sensitivity. The amount of intrinsic blur increased for retinal eccentricities beyond 4° (p < 0.001) and was lower in binocular than monocular conditions (p < 0.001), but was similar across refractive groups (p = 0.47). Blur sensitivity decreased with retinal eccentricity (p < 0.001) and was highest for binocular viewing, but only for central vision (p < 0.05). Myopes showed worse blur sensitivity than emmetropes monocularly (p < 0.05) but not binocularly (p = 0.66). As expected, blur perception worsens in the visual periphery and binocular summation is most evident in central vision. Furthermore, myopes exhibit a monocular impairment in blur sensitivity that improves under binocular conditions. Implications for the development of myopia are discussed.",

The present study aimed to assess the efficacy of a recently developed MLV vaccine (Ingelvac PRRSFLEX® EU) in piglets at 2 and 3-weeks of age in the presence of homologous maternally derived antibodies as the dams were vaccinated with the same vaccine strain (ReproCyc® PRRS EU). The study was carried out on a Hungarian farrow to finish farm naturally infected with PRRSv. The study was designed as a blind, placebo controlled side by side trial. ORF5 sequence similarity of the vaccine strain and the resident field strain was 87.8 %. PRRS specific real-time quantitative PCR was performed from serum samples to measure both the viral load and the frequency of virus positive animals. At the time of the natural infection observed in the control group at 10-12 weeks of age, the number of viraemic animals did not increase significantly in the vaccinated group. To understand the infection dynamics, positive PCR samples with low Ct values were sequenced (ORF5) and the data analysis indicated the circulation of wild type virus in both groups, however wild type virus was only found in non-vaccinated animals. Our data indicate that piglets vaccinated at as early as 2 weeks of age with Ingelvac PRRSFLEX® EU were protected both in terms of proportion of viraemic animals and viraemia levels. It has to be highlighted that these results were achieved in piglets with high levels of homologous maternally derived antibodies (MDA) at the time of vaccination.",

The 5-year mortality was similar between men and women at age <65 years (16% vs. 15%, P=0.99), whereas it was significantly higher in men than in women at age ≥65 years (65-74 years, 38% vs. 19%, P<0.0001; 75-84 years, 55% vs. 34%, P<0.0001; ≥85 years: 82% vs. 72%, P=0.03). A large Japanese multicenter registry of consecutive patients with severe AS included a much higher proportion of women than men, with the female: male sex ratio increasing with age. The 5-year mortality rate of women was lower than that of men. Lower 5-year mortality rates in women were consistently seen across all age groups >65 years.",
